SAO PAULO/MONTREAL, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Russia has informed Brazil's aircraft investigation authority that it will not probe the crash of the Brazilian-made Embraer (EMBR3.SA) jet that killed mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin under international rules "at the moment", the Brazilian agency told Reuters on Tuesday.
Prigozhin, two top lieutenants of his Wagner Group and four bodyguards were among 10 people who died when the Embraer Legacy 600 crashed north of Moscow last week.
He died two months to the day after staging a brief mutiny against the Russian defense establishment that posed the biggest challenge to President Vladimir Putin's rule since he rose to power in 1999.
Brazil's Center for Research and Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents (CENIPA), in the interests of improving aviation safety, had said it would join a Russian-led investigation if it were invited and the probe held under international rules.
Russia’s aviation authority was not obligated to say yes to CENIPA, but some former investigators said it should, as the U.S. and other Western governments suspect the Kremlin of being behind the Aug. 23 crash of the Embraer Legacy 600, which has a good safety record.
The Kremlin denies any involvement. Prigozhin was publicly critical of Moscow's prosecution of its invasion of Ukraine. The Wagner mercenaries fought battles there on Russia's side.
According to the Montreal-based United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the flight from Moscow with a destination of St Petersburg was domestic, so it is not subject to international rules known throughout the industry by their legal name "Annex 13."
"They are not obliged, only recommended to do that," CENIPA head Air Brigadier Marcelo Moreno told Reuters after the agency sent an email last week asking Russia whether it would open such a probe.
"But if they say they’ll open the investigation and invite Brazil we will participate from afar."
U.S. aviation safety consultant and former investigator John Cox said an internal Russian investigation would always be questioned without the participation of Brazil, the country where the plane was manufactured.
"I think it’s very sad," Cox said after being told of the Russian response. "I think it hurts the transparency of the Russian investigation."
CENIPA said in an emailed statement it got the response from the Interstate Aviation Committee - Commission on Accident Investigation (IAC) on Tuesday, with the Russian authority saying it would not open for now a probe under Annex 13.
In air crash investigations, experts work to improve aviation safety without assigning blame, but probes are often tainted by political interests.
CENIPA and manufacturer Embraer want to prevent future accidents but face challenges in getting information from the investigation due to sanctions on Russia and Moscow's reluctance to allow outside scrutiny.
Some 802 Embraer regional jets with 37 to 50 seats, built on the same platform as the Legacy 600 corporate aircraft, are in service, underscoring Brazilian interest in the probe.
Embraer declined comment.
Jeff Guzzetti, a former U.S. air crash investigator, said Russia should accept assistance from Brazil, even if CENIPA can only participate remotely.
"If they don't, well, then that's a sure sign that it's not going to be a transparent investigation."
Drawing their name from an annex to the Convention on International Civil Aviation - commonly known as the 1944 Chicago Convention - the rules represent a low-key but effective form of international cooperation that has rarely been challenged.
By promoting unusually close technical co-operation across political frontiers and steering clear of issues of blame, Annex 13 has been credited with improving air safety dramatically since it was first introduced, safety officials said.

Headline: Gabon officers declare military coup, President Ali Bongo detained
Article Content:
LIBREVILLE, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Military officers in oil-producing Gabon said they had seized power on Wednesday and had put President Ali Bongo under house arrest, stepping in minutes after the Central African state's election body announced he had won a third term.
The officers who said they represented the armed forces declared on television that the election results were cancelled, borders were closed and state institutions were dissolved, after a tense vote that was set to extend the Bongo family's more than half century in power.
One of the officers, Brice Oligui Nguema, who in a video appeared to be hailed as their leader, told French newspaper Le Monde that he and other generals would meet on Wednesday to select someone to head the transitional government.
Hundreds of people on the streets of the Gabonese capital celebrated the military's intervention, while France, Gabon's former colonial ruler which has troops stationed in the African nation, condemned the coup.
If successful, the Gabon coup would be the eighth in West and Central Africa since 2020. The latest one, in Niger, was in July. Military officers have also seized power in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Chad, erasing democratic gains since the 1990s.
"I am marching today because I am joyful. After almost 60 years, the Bongos are out of power," said Jules Lebigui, a jobless 27-year-old who joined crowds in Libreville.
The officers said they had detained Bongo, who took over in 2009 from his father Omar, who had ruled since 1967. They also said they had arrested the president's son, Noureddin Bongo Valentin, and others for corruption and treason.
Opponents say the family has done little to share the state's oil and mining wealth with its 2.3 million people. Violent unrest had broken out after Bongo's disputed 2016 election win and there was a foiled coup attempt in 2019.
The Gabon officers, calling themselves The Committee of Transition and the Restoration of Institutions, said the country faced "a severe institutional, political, economic, and social crisis". They said the Aug. 26 vote was not credible.
Republican Guard chief Nguema told Le Monde a leader had not been chosen but a meeting would be held on Wednesday to decide.
"Everyone will put forward ideas and the best ones will be chosen, as well as the name of the person who will lead the transition," he said.
Television images showed a man who appeared to be Nguema held aloft by soldiers shouting "Oligui president", using one of his names.
There was no immediate comment from Gabon's government.

Bongo, 64, was last seen in public casting his vote on Saturday. Before the vote, he had been seen looking healthier than his more frail television appearances after his 2018 stroke.
"We condemn the military coup and recall our commitment to free and transparent elections," French government spokesman Olivier Veran said.
The coup creates more uncertainty for France's presence in the region. France has about 350 troops in Gabon. Its forces have been kicked out of Mali and Burkina Faso after coups there in the last two years.
Unlike Niger and other Sahel countries, Gabon, which lies further south on the Atlantic coast, has not had to battle destabilising Islamist insurgencies. But the coup is a further sign of democratic backsliding in the volatile region.
The African Union's Peace and Security Council chair called for a meeting on situation with Burundi, Senegal and Cameroon,
China called for a peaceful resolution and Russia said it hoped for a swift return to stability.
"With the coup leaders claiming to represent all factions of Gabon's security apparatus, Mr Bongo is not expected to be able to suppress the uprising," wrote Rukmini Sanyal, an analyst at Economist Intelligence Unit, citing "widespread public discontent" against Bongo, his family and his ruling party.
Gabon produces about 200,000 barrels of oil a day, mainly from depleting fields. International companies include France's TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) and Anglo-French producer Perenco.
French miner Eramet (ERMT.PA), which has large manganese operations in Gabon, said it had halted operations.
A lack of international observers, the suspension of some foreign broadcasts and a decision to cut internet service and impose a night-time curfew after Saturday's election had raised concerns about the vote's transparency. Bongo's team rejected allegations of fraud.
On Wednesday, internet access appeared to be restored for the first time since the vote.
Shortly before the coup announcement, the election authority had declared Bongo the election winner with 64.27% of the vote and said his main challenger, Albert Ondo Ossa, had secured 30.77%.
Gabon's dollar-denominated bonds fell as much as 14 cents on Wednesday before recovering around 2 cents of the losses.

Headline: Category 3 Hurricane Idalia slams ashore at Florida's Big Bend
Article Content:
STEINHATCHEE, Florida, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida as an "extremely dangerous" Category 3 storm on Wednesday after millions of residents evacuated or hunkered down in homes and shelters in anticipation of a life-threatening storm surge.
Drawing strength from the Gulf of Mexico's warm waters, Idalia unleashed destructive winds and torrential downpours that were forecast to cause coastal flooding up to 16 feet (4.88 m) deep along the state's Gulf Coast.
Idalia came ashore at 7:45 a.m. EDT (1145 GMT) at Keaton Beach, an ocean-front community of 13,000 people in Taylor County, about 75 miles (121 km) southeast of Tallahassee, the state capital. The town lies in the center of the Big Bend region, where the state's northern panhandle curves into the Florida Peninsula.
"It's just ripping through Taylor County now. Hope all is safe," County Commissioner Jamie English told Reuters. "Winds gusting. Terrible power outages all over. Debris flying everywhere."
Video footage from Keaton Beach posted on social media platform X by storm chaser Sidney Grimmett showed heavy downpours and trees whipping in the wind as an electrical line sparked along the side of a roadway.
Overnight, attained "an extremely dangerous Category 4 intensity" on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale on its way to landfall in Florida Wednesday morning, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami said.
But by 7 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT) it weakened slightly, slipping into Category 3, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (201 km). Any storm reaching Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane.
Sparsely populated compared with the Tampa-St. Petersburg area to the south, the Big Bend features a marshy coast, threaded with freshwater springs and rivers, and a cluster of small offshore islands forming Cedar Key, a historic fishing village demolished in 1896 by a hurricane's storm surge.
Early Wednesday morning, storm winds were knocking bent palm tree tops against Ken Wood's house in Dunedin, near Tampa and 185 miles south of landfall.
Wood, 57, a bridge tender in Pinellas County, did not heed evacuation orders even after he shut down the bridge between on the Dunedin Causeway on Tuesday, saying he figured he was on high enough ground.
"Mainly it's a lot of loud wind and rain right now, some thunder," he told Reuters by telephone, adding that roads were flooded. "The sky is dark."

Most of Florida's 21 million residents, and many in the adjacent states of Georgia and South Carolina, were under hurricane warnings and other storm-related advisories. State emergency declarations were issued in all three.
Florida's Gulf Coast, southeastern Georgia and eastern parts of North and South Carolina could face 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) of rain through Thursday, with isolated areas seeing as much as a foot of rain (30 cm), the hurricane center warned.
Officials said the storm's most dangerous feature would be a powerful surge of wind-driven surf that is expected to flood barrier islands and other low-lying areas along the coast.
Surge warnings were posted for hundreds of miles of shoreline, from Sarasota to the sport fishing haven of Indian Pass at the western end of Apalachicola Bay. In some areas, the surge could rise as high as 16 feet (4.9 m), the NHC said.
"If you end up with a storm surge that even approaches 16 feet, the chances of surviving that are not great," DeSantis said. "You would need to be in a three-story building because it is going to rise very, very high."
At the White House on Tuesday, U.S. President Biden said he and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the Republican nomination to challenge Biden in the 2024 presidential election, were "in constant contact" about storm preparations.
Biden was set to speak about the government's hurricane response efforts later on Wednesday.
Idalia grew from a tropical storm into a hurricane early on Tuesday, a day after passing west of Cuba, where it damaged homes, knocked out power, flooded villages and prompted mass evacuations.
It was the fourth major hurricane to strike Florida in the past seven years, following Irma in 2017, Michael in 2018 and Ian, which peaked at Category 5, last September.
More than 40 school districts in Florida canceled classes, DeSantis said, and Tampa International Airport suspended commercial operations on Tuesday.
About 5,500 National Guard members were mobilized, while 30,000 to 40,000 electricity workers were on standby. The state has set aside 1.1 million gallons of gasoline to address interruptions to fuel supplies, the governor said.

Headline: Ukrainian drones strike six Russian regions, destroy planes at airfield
Article Content:
Aug 30 (Reuters) - Ukrainian drones struck targets in at least six regions deep within Russia on Wednesday, including an airfield where they destroyed military transport planes, in one of the broadest volleys yet of Kyiv's campaign to turn the tables on Moscow.
Russian officials described attacks on targets in the Pskov, Bryansk, Kaluga, Orlov, Ryazan and Moscow regions. The Russian foreign ministry said the attacks would "not go unpunished" and the drones could not have reached so far into Russian territory without Western help.
In Pskov, in northern Russia more than 600 km (400 miles) from Ukraine, a huge fire erupted at a military airfield that garrisons elite paratroopers. Tass news agency reported at least four giant Il-76 transport planes were damaged, two of which had "burst into flames".
The attacks coincided with Russia's most severe air strikes on Ukraine's capital for months. Authorities in Kyiv reported at least two people had been killed as debris from intercepted missiles fell in four locations.
Reuters captured footage of a fireball falling out of the night sky close to a supermarket, detonating in a huge explosion that lit up nearby apartment blocks. Moscow said it hit command and intelligence targets.
In Russia, the governor of Pskov posted video on Telegram showing a huge fire with the sounds of sirens and an explosion at the air base. Other video posted online showed anti-aircraft systems in action around the city, which is just 32 km (20 miles) east of Russia's border with NATO-member Estonia.
Moscow said it had thwarted all the attacks on Russia. Russia typically describes all Ukrainian drone strikes as unsuccessful, regardless of the damage on the ground.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was working out where the drones were launched from to prevent further strikes. President Vladimir Putin had been informed immediately, as would be the case in any such "massive attacks", Peskov said.
Kyiv confirmed the Russian planes had been destroyed in Pskov, without commenting on the nature of the incident. It generally withholds comment on strikes on territory inside Russia though it says it has a right to hit military targets.
"Yes, four IL-76 transport planes were destroyed in Pskov at an airfield, they are beyond repair. Also, several other of those (aircraft) are damaged, but the information is being checked," Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s GUR military agency, told Reuters.
Ukraine's Western allies generally forbid Kyiv from using weapons they supply to attack Russia but say Kyiv has a right to carry out such strikes with its own weapons.
Among the other attacks in Russia, Moscow said Ukrainian drones had tried to attack a TV tower over the Bryansk region. No casualties were reported.
Moscow also said its aircraft had destroyed four Ukrainian fast-attack boats carrying up to 50 paratroopers on the Black Sea and its forces had repelled attacks by enemy drones. Reuters could not independently confirm this.

Attacks on Russia in recent weeks, including repeated drone strikes on central Moscow, have brought the war home to many Russians for the first time, even as Ukrainians have spent the past year and a half in constant peril from air strikes.
Moscow has relentlessly pounded Ukrainian cities with long range missiles and drone strikes throughout the war. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed.
Ukraine said its air defences had shot down 28 Russian missiles and 15 out of 16 drones fired overnight.
"Kyiv has not experienced such a powerful attack since spring. The enemy launched a massive, combined attack using drones and missiles," Serhiy Popko, the head of the city's military administration, said on Telegram.
At the front line, Ukrainian forces have been advancing in a summer offensive for nearly three months. They have yet to achieve a breakthrough of Russia's heavily mined and fortified defenses, although they have claimed in just the past week to have finally penetrated the first main defensive line.
On the outskirts of St Petersburg, followers of Yevgeny Prigozhin, boss of Russia's Wagner private army, paid tribute at a leafy cemetery where he was buried six days after being killed in a plane crash. A tribute left beside flowers read: "To be a warrior is to live forever".
"It is a big loss for Russia," said Sergei Abeltsev, a former lawmaker from an ultra-nationalist party, who visited the grave. "As always - the realisation of the loss will only come later."
The Kremlin has said foul play was one of the causes being investigated for the crash. It has rejected as an "absolute lie" Western suggestions that Putin was responsible.
"It is obvious that different versions are being considered, including the version - you know what we are talking about – let's say, a deliberate atrocity," Kremlin spokesman Peskov said.
Prigozhin, two top Wagner lieutenants and four bodyguards were among 10 people who died when his Embraer Legacy 600 private jet crashed in unexplained circumstances on Aug. 23, two months after Wagner marched on Moscow in a brief mutiny.
Putin had called the mutiny treason but had promised Prigozhin he would escape punishment. Western countries say there is little doubt Prigozhin was killed on Putin's orders.
"We all know that the Kremlin has a long history of killing opponents," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. "It's very clear what happened here."

Headline: US Commerce chief leaves China on upbeat note after 'uninvestible' remark
Article Content:
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, left, talks with Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Jining, in Shanghai, China, Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023. Andy Wong/Pool via REUTERS  Acquire Licensing Rights
SHANGHAI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo talked up American firms' desire to do business in China and her hopes for further engagement with Chinese officials on market access on Wednesday, after earlier comments over China being "uninvestible."
At a press conference in Shanghai, Raimondo said she had not expected any breakthroughs on issues affecting U.S. firms such as Intel (INTC.O), Micron (MU.O), Boeing (BA.N), Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N) in her first meetings with Chinese officials, but did hope to "see some results" in the next few months as a result of her four-day visit to Beijing and Shanghai.
Raimondo said there was strong appetite among U.S. businesses to make the relationship work and that, while some actions of the Chinese government have been positive, the situation on the ground needed to match the rhetoric.
"There is appetite among U.S. business to continue to do business (in China). The market is enormous," she said. "U.S. businesses want to do business here but they need to have a predictable regulatory environment."
The commerce secretary is the latest Biden administration official to visit China in a bid to strengthen communications, particularly on economics and defence, amid concern that friction between the two superpower could spiral out of control.
Raimondo insists the U.S. does not want to decouple from China. "I am leaving with some optimism," Raimondo said of agreements to continue dialogue on a lot of tough issues. "We can't drift to a place of greater of conflict. It's not good for the U.S., it's not good for China, it's not good for the world."
On Tuesday she had told reporters on a high-speed train to Shanghai from Beijing that American companies had complained to her that China has become "uninvestible," pointing to fines, raids and other actions that have made it risky to do business in the world's second-largest economy.
On Wednesday she said: "For U.S. business in many cases patience is running thin and it's time for action."
Raimondo said she had raised with Chinese officials that her emails had been hacked and said that was an "action that erodes trust." Reuters reported in July that Raimondo was among a group of U.S. officials whose emails were hacked earlier this year by a group Microsoft (MSFT.O) says is based in China.
Her comment on the difficulties U.S. businesses face has shone a harsh light on trade and investment flows between the geopolitical rivals.
"The essence of China-U.S. economic and trade relations is mutual benefit," Wang Wenbin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said on Wednesday, citing Premier Li Qiang's remarks during his meeting with Raimondo on Tuesday.
"Politicizing and securitising economic and trade issues not only seriously affects the relationship and mutual trust between the two countries, it also harms the interests of their businesses and peoples," he added.
Companies have been at the center of a power struggle between the two countries for several years. China has criticised U.S. efforts to block China's access to advanced semiconductors through export controls.
Raimondo said export control dialogue was to reduce misunderstandings.
"We were able clarify at the first meeting that we are not targeting China," she said. "We're targeting actions and behaviour that undermine U.S. national security." She reiterated on Wednesday that the United States is not willing to negotiate or change export controls.
The two biggest economies in the world used to be each other's largest trade partners, but Washington is now trading more with neighbouring Canada and Mexico, while Beijing is trading more with Southeast Asia.
Global investors, who have been spooked by unpredictable crackdowns in China on sectors from e-commerce to education in recent years, have also been streaming out of Chinese assets lately.
Foreign net selling of 82.9 billion yuan ($11.4 billion) in Chinese stocks this month is a record outflow. Corporate investment is also going missing, with foreign direct investment (FDI) at its lowest since records began 25 years ago.
Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said businesses had been "very clear" in making their concerns known to the Chinese government.
"Certain actions, including raids on companies and restricting data flows, are not conducive to attracting additional FDI," Hart said.
That sentiment was echoed by Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, who said "'uninvestible' is not a term we would use to describe China," instead describing it as "under-invested".
Raimondo said U.S. firms were facing new challenges, among them "exorbitant fines without any explanation, revisions to the counterespionage law, which are unclear and sending shockwaves through the U.S. community; raids on businesses – a whole new level of challenge and we need that to be addressed."
Raimondo, in opening remarks at a meeting on Wednesday morning with Shanghai Communist Party Secretary Chen Jining, struck a positive tone, saying she wanted to discuss "concrete ways that we can work together to accomplish business goals and to bring about a more predictable business environment, a predictable regulatory environment and a level playing field for American businesses."
Chen said a stable relationship between China and the United States was crucial for the world, adding that Shanghai had the highest concentration of U.S. businesses in China.
On Wednesday afternoon, the commerce secretary visited Shanghai Disneyland and a Boeing facility in the city, touting two prominent American exports.
Disney (DIS.N) has emphasized its Chinese links since Shanghai Disneyland - a joint venture with state-owned Shendi Group - opened in 2016.
Raimondo, who has said China was blocking tens of billions of dollars in deliveries of Boeing airplanes to Chinese airlines, on Tuesday said she raised the airlines' refusal to accept delivery of Boeing 737 MAX airplanes but won no commitments.

Headline: High pasta prices set to boil over as Canada's wheat withers
Article Content:
[1/3]A worker at the Italian pasta maker De Cecco's factory prepares pasta in Fara San Martino, Italy, November 29, 2021. Pasta makers are fearful of a substantial supply squeeze in the coming months after this summer's durum wheat price shock, as the market runs out of ways to offset a dire harvest in  Acquire Licensing Rights Read more
PARIS/WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Aug 30 - Pasta lovers must brace to pay even higher prices for their favorite dish, as drought in Canada and bad weather in Europe damages crops of durum wheat and reduces supplies available to flour millers and food companies.
Italy's government called a crisis meeting in May as prices for the staple food jumped by more than double the national inflation rate. With global production of durum wheat headed for a 22-year low, Italy's famed pasta makers have had to turn to unusual suppliers such as Turkey for their main ingredient.
In Toronto, Continental Noodles knew there was trouble when the cost of a 20-kilogram bag of semolina flour, milled from durum, rose 24% in a few weeks of July to C$26 ($19.15). Family-owned Continental, which sells fettuccine and ravioli to Whole Foods and the general public, is also paying more for tomatoes used in sauce after crop setbacks in Spain and India.
One of Continental's owners, Vincent Liberatore, fears prices will rise even more now that farmers in top durum exporter Canada have seen their harvest devastated by drought. He said the business will absorb the costs as long as possible, uncertain how much more consumers will pay.
"The population has tapped out - everything has been going up," Liberatore said. "The biggest stress for us business owners right now is the unknown - the roller coaster up and down."
Retail pasta prices rose about 12% this year in Europe and 8% in the United States, according to market research firm Nielsen. Prices of another staple, rice, have also spiked following export curbs in India.
The International Grains Council forecasts 2023/24 global durum production at a 22-year low, pushing world stocks to their smallest in three decades.
When the Prairies turned dry this summer, Canadian farmer Darold Niwa saw hopes of a bumper durum harvest dashed.
"Until June 10, I felt I was sitting pretty," Niwa, 67, said from his farm near Oyen, Alberta. Now "we'll probably take a loss."
Niwa's durum has produced only six to eight kernels per head, instead of the usual 45-52. His break-even level is 32-35 bushels per acre (bpa) but he is harvesting just 10-11 bpa, about 1 metric ton per hectare.
Canada accounts for around half of global trade in durum but this year's harvest looks to be the country's second-smallest harvest in 12 years. Canadian farmers are expected to produce 4.3 million metric tons of durum this year, Statistics Canada reported on Tuesday.
"The pipeline in Canada is empty," said agriculture analyst Jerry Klassen.
The United States is also expected to harvest a smaller crop due to dryness, while drought has cut production in Spain and severe weather has produced mixed quality in Italy and France.
Deteriorating supplies drove up the Euronext futures price benchmark to a six-month peak in early August. The spike led major importer Algeria to cancel a durum tender in early August. The major importer announced a new tender this week.
In Italy, which relies on imports to complement domestic crops, some firms are turning to new supply sources. Turkey has emerged as a surprise durum exporter.
Market estimates place Turkish durum export sales so far this season at 300,000 metric tons, with most bound for Italy.
Traders said Turkey is tapping a bumper harvest and high stocks to reverse its usual role as an importer. Its exports are widely expected to reach 500,000 tons and possibly 1 million depending on government export approvals.
The Turkish trade ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Turkish exports have cooled Mediterranean and North American durum prices, but they should resume their climb when Turkey runs out in a month or two, said Philip Werle, partner at Spain-based Northstar Brokerage.
Short-term supply relief has also come from Russia, which has shipped over 100,000 tons to the European Union since July according to EU import data.
Pasta giant Barilla, which processes local durum in various countries, said it currently saw no critical supply issues.
Consultancy Strategie Grains says pasta makers could possibly use more soft wheat where regulations allow and consumer income is limited. Durum, the hardest wheat, produces pasta with the prized "al dente" firm texture, unlike soft wheat. In North Africa, durum is also used to make couscous.
"There's not going to be enough durum to supply the whole world at a normal demand level," Strategie Grains analyst Severine Omnes-Maisons said.
In the meantime, Vincenzo Martinelli, president of the durum section of Italian millers association Italmopa, nervously awaits the outcome of the Canadian harvest.
"Without Canada, prices will only go up," he said.

Headline: Sentencing of two ex-Proud Boys leaders postponed due to "emergency"

WASHINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The sentencing hearings for two former leaders of the right-wing Proud Boys who were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes for the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol by Donald Trump supporters has been postponed, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia in a statement said the sentencing hearings will not proceed "due to an emergency."
"When we get more information, we will share it," she added.
Prosecutors were planning to ask U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly to sentence Enrique Tarrio, the group's former chairman, to 33 years in prison and to sentence his co-defendant Ethan Nordean, another former leader, to 27 years.
Those recommendations exceed the longest sentence handed out so far over the assault by the former president's supporters on the seat of government, including Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who was sentenced in May to serve 18 years.
The attack was meant to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election, which Trump falsely claims was the result of widespread fraud.
Trump currently holds a wide lead in the race for the Republican nomination to challenge Biden in 2024.

TOLEDO, Spain, Aug 30 (Reuters) - European Union defence ministers are to discuss the situation in Gabon, foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Wednesday, adding that a coup, if confirmed, would heap more instability on the region.
A group of senior Gabonese military officers appeared on national television in the early hours of Wednesday and said they had taken power, after the state election body announced President Ali Bongo had won a third term.
"If this is confirmed, it is another military coup which increases instability in the whole region," said Borrell, speaking at a meeting of EU defence ministers in Toledo.
"The whole area, starting with Central African Republic, then Mali, then Burkina Faso, now Niger, maybe Gabon, it's in a very difficult situation and certainly the ministers ... have to have a deep thought on what is going on there and how we can improve our policy in respect with these countries," he said.
"This is a big issue for Europe," he added.
The signs of a coup in Gabon come just weeks after members of the presidential guard in Niger seized power and established a junta.

Headline: Hurricane Idalia: path, map and what to expect when it hits Florida
Article Content:
[1/5]Men cut plywood in front of a store ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Idalia in Cedar Key, Florida, U.S., August 29, 2023. REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights
Aug 30 (Reuters) - Millions of Florida residents secured boats and properties and fled to higher ground on Wednesday as Idalia intensified to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 hurricane and threatened a direct hit on the state's Big Bend region.
Evacuations were ordered in 28 of Florida's 67 counties as of late Tuesday. Most of the state and parts of Georgia and South Carolina are under storm warnings or advisories.
Here are the most important things to know about Idalia's projected impact.
Idalia grew from a tropical storm into a Category 4 hurricane on its way to landfall in Florida early on Wednesday, after causing floods in western Cuba that forced residents of coastal towns to seek higher ground.
As of 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT) on Wednesday, Idalia was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (215 kph) as it churned toward shore 60 miles (95 km) west of Cedar Key, Florida.
Three major hurricanes have struck Florida in the past seven years: Irma in 2017, Michael in 2018 and Ian last September.
Idalia's center will likely cross Florida's coastline somewhere in the Big Bend region, where the state's northern panhandle meets the Gulf side of the Florida peninsula, the NHC projected.
WHAT ARE 'STORM SURGES' and 'KING TIDES'?
The deadliest threat Idalia poses is a surging wall of seawater 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6 m) high that could flood low-lying areas along Florida's coast, according to authorities.
"Storm surges" occur when high winds and atmospheric pressure from an oncoming hurricane force ocean water onto land. The resulting floodwaters may take a couple of days to subside.
A "king tide" - the highest type of high tide, caused by the extra gravitational pull that occurs when the sun and moon align with Earth - is also expected on Wednesday, which will likely exacerbate the surges from Idalia.
Hundreds of miles of Florida shoreline are under storm surge warnings as Idalia approaches, from Apalachicola Bay in the panhandle through Tampa, the state's third-largest city, and down to Sarasota in the south.
Authorities are scrambling to move thousands of Florida residents out of danger before nightfall.
The Florida emergency management agency listed 28 counties with evacuation orders.
Sixteen counties issued mandatory evacuation orders for certain residents, especially those living in coastal and flood-prone areas or in mobile homes, recreational vehicles or structurally unsound housing.
Local authorities opened dozens of shelters for evacuees. They urged residents to take the evacuation orders seriously. "Please do not become complacent – take action now if you have not done so already," wrote the sheriff's office of Citrus County, north of Tampa, in a Facebook post.
Even Floridians not under evacuation orders should expect disruptions as a result of Idalia, from power outages to shuttered schools and businesses.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for 46 Florida counties. About 5,500 National Guard members were mobilized, while 30,000 to 40,000 electricity workers were on standby to help restore power quickly after the hurricane passes.
School districts around the region canceled classes starting on Monday afternoon. Tampa International Airport closed commercial operations and did not expect to resume until Thursday.

Headline: Exclusive: U.S military in talks to develop port in Philippines facing Taiwan
Article Content:

MANILA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. military is in talks to develop a civilian port in the remote northernmost islands of the Philippines, the local governor and two other officials told Reuters, a move that would boost American access to strategically located islands facing Taiwan.
U.S. military involvement in the proposed port in the Batanes islands, less than 200 km (125 miles) from Taiwan, could stoke tensions at a time of growing friction with China and a drive by Washington to intensify its longstanding defence treaty engagement with the Philippines.
The Bashi Channel between those islands and Taiwan is considered a choke point for vessels moving between the western Pacific and the contested South China Sea and a key waterway in the case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The Chinese military regularly sends ships and aircraft through the channel, Taiwan's defence ministry has said.
Marilou Cayco, the provincial governor of the Batanes islands, told Reuters in a message she had sought funding from the U.S. for the building of an "an alternative port" there, which was intended to assist the unloading of cargo from the capital, Manila, during rough seas in the monsoon season.
She said the plans were to build a port on Basco island, where local authorities say high waves often make the existing port inaccessible, and that a decision could be made in October.
The Philippines has in the past year almost doubled the number of its military bases that U.S. forces can access, ostensibly for humanitarian assistance, and also has thousands of U.S. troops in the country at any given time, rotating in and out for joint training exercises. China has said these U.S. moves were "stoking the fire" of regional tensions.
The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposed port in Basco.
Two other Filipino officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media, said U.S troops had visited Batanes recently to discuss the port.
One, a senior military official, said the Filipino armed forces were interested in radar and improving monitoring capabilities in the area.
Cayco confirmed the visit, saying they came "one time to assess" the proposed alternative port.
The move comes as Washington pursues closer ties with Asian nations to counter China in the Asia-Pacific region, including the Philippines, its former colony and treaty ally.
Kanishka Gangopadhyay, a spokesperson for the U.S embassy in Manila, said U.S. Embassy and U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC) experts had been engaging the governor and local government, "at their request, to discuss ways USARPAC can support engineering, medical, and agricultural development projects in the province."
He did not mention the port specifically.
Previous President Rodrigo Duterte had threatened to scrap the U.S.-Philippines alliance and realign the country with Beijing but relations between China and the Philippines have grown tense under the current president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
Marcos, the son and namesake of the disgraced late strongman president, has sought closer ties with Washington, granting it access to four more military bases, including several close to Taiwan, though not in Batanes, and announced joint patrols in the South China Sea.
Marcos has said the bases under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) could prove useful if China attacked Taiwan.
Security officials in Manila said they believed any military conflict in the Taiwan Strait would inevitably affect the Philippines, given its geographic proximity to Taiwan and the presence of over 150,000 Filipinos on the democratically-governed island.
Batanes also served as one of the training sites during this year's joint military exercises, known as Balikatan, which involved more than 17,000 Filipino and American troops, making it the biggest ever edition of the military drill.
At the time of the exercise, Cayco said she was seeking investment to build seaports and airports in the island province that is home to 18,000 people. The province could harbour Filipinos fleeing Taiwan if conflict breaks out there and residents have been worried about mounting tensions, according to local government officials.
The Philippines and China have also clashed in recent months over disputed waters in the South China Sea, with Chinese vessels firing water cannons on a Filipino vessel trying to send supplies to an outpost.
Cayco said she didn't have any conversation with the U.S. about EDCA or about radar installations.
She also said there had not yet been discussions about what access the U.S would have to the proposed port, but troops could use all ports in the area for regular military exercises like the Balikatan.
Jay Batongbacal, maritime affairs expert at the University of the Philippines, said the proposed port "would certainly be needed for the island’s defence in a worst case scenario."
"If I were a Chinese strategist, I would want to take the Batanes at minimum in order to ensure control of the Luzon straits and use the island to prevent the approach of adversary naval forces," he said.

Headline: Recent coups in West and Central Africa
Article Content:
Gaboneses nationals prepare to cast their vote at a polling station during the presidential election in Libreville, Gabon August 26, 2023 REUTERS/Gerauds Wilfried Obangome /file photo  Acquire Licensing Rights
Aug 30 (Reuters) - A group of senior military officers in Gabon announced on national television on Wednesday they had taken power and election results were annulled, just minutes after President Ali Bongo was declared to have won a third term.
If successful the coup would represent the eighth since 2020 in West and Central Africa, a region that in the last decade had made strides to shed its reputation as a "coup belt", only for persistent insecurity and corruption to open the door to military leaders.
Here is a list of some recent coups:
In July 2023, members of Niger's presidential guard detained President Mohamed Bazoum inside his palace and appeared on national television saying they were seizing power to end the "deteriorating security situation and bad governance."
Days later the junta declared the head of the presidential guard, Abdourahamane Tiani, the new head of state, raising concerns about the security of a region where Niger has been a key ally of Western powers seeking to contain insurgencies by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State.
The main West African bloc ECOWAS has been trying to negotiate with the coup leaders but said it was ready to send troops into Niger to restore constitutional order if diplomatic efforts failed.
Niger has authorised Mali and Burkina Faso's armed forces to intervene on its territory in case of an attack.
In January 2022, Burkina Faso's army ousted President Roch Kabore, blaming him for failing to contain violence by Islamist militants.
Coup leader Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Damiba pledged to restore security, but attacks worsened, eroding morale in the armed forces that led to a second coup in September 2022 when current junta leader Captain Ibrahim Traore seized power.
In September 2021, special forces commander Colonel Mamady Doumbouya ousted President Alpha Conde. A year earlier, Conde had changed the constitution to circumvent limits that would have prevented him from standing for a third term, triggering widespread rioting.
Doumbouya became interim president and promised a transition to democratic elections within three years.
ECOWAS rejected the timeline and imposed sanctions on junta members and their relatives, including freezing their bank accounts.
The military regime later proposed to start the 24-month transition in January 2023, but opposition parties say it has done little to put in place institutions and a roadmap to return to constitutional rule.
In April 2021, Chad's army took power after President Idriss Deby was killed on the battlefield while visiting troops fighting rebels in the north.
Under Chadian law, the speaker of parliament should have become president. But a military council stepped in and dissolved parliament in the name of ensuring stability.
Deby's son, General Mahamat Idriss Deby, was named interim president and tasked with overseeing an 18-month transition to elections.
The unconstitutional transfer of power led to riots in the capital N'Djamena that were put down by the military.
In August 2020, a group of Malian colonels led by Assimi Goita ousted President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. The coup followed anti-government protests over deteriorating security, contested legislative elections and allegations of corruption.
Under pressure from Mali's West African neighbours, the junta agreed to cede power to a civilian-led interim government tasked with overseeing an 18-month transition to democratic elections to be held in February 2022.
But the coup leaders clashed with the interim president, retired colonel Bah Ndaw, and engineered a second coup in May 2021. Goita, who had served as interim vice president, was elevated to the presidency.
ECOWAS lifted some of the sanctions on Mali after the military rulers proposed a two-year transition to democracy and published a new electoral law. The country is scheduled to hold a presidential election in February 2024 to return to constitutional rule.

Headline: As inflation soars, Argentines say they've seen this film before
Article Content:

BUENOS AIRES, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Argentina is battling against triple digit inflation, its highest in over three decades, and that could climb to near 200% by the end of the year, stirring memories of hyperinflation in the late 1980s and other economic crises.
Rapidly rising prices, which have sped up this month after the government allowed a near 20% devaluation of the peso currency, are hammering consumers, pushing up poverty and stoking voter anger ahead of October general elections.
With costs often varying day-to-day, the specter of runaway inflation of years past has returned, despite hopes it can still be avoided and regular government measures including sharp interest rate hikes and price freezes to tamp inflation down.
"This is like a movie one has already seen several times," said Roberto Gonzalez Blanco, a retired 80-year-old public accountant, who has four daughters and 11 grandchildren, one of whom went to Australia in search of better opportunities.
The high inflation rate, which J.P. Morgan has forecast could hit 190% this year, has left four-in-10 people in poverty as prices have risen faster than wages, leading to a cost-of-living crisis and stoking anger on the streets. August monthly inflation is likely to top 10%, analysts say.
That has also boosted an outsider radical presidential candidate, Javier Milei, who came first in an August open primary election, beating the two main traditional parties and making himself the favorite in what remains an uncertain race.
He has pledged to dollarize the economy over time and shutter the central bank, blaming a "caste" of political elite for the economic crisis in boisterous tirades to cheering supporters who love his abrasive, no holds barred style.
Nora Marful, 63, a former bank employee, said she felt none of the presidential candidates represented her as a working Argentine. Milei will compete against Economy Minister Sergio Massa and conservative ex-Security Minister Patricia Bullrich.
"I am very afraid of what is coming. It seems to me that it is the same as what I experienced years ago, in 2015, in 2001," she said, referring to past economic crises in the country.
"The way I see it, these characters are focused on a certain sector, a sector of wealth, well-being, upper class. They forget about the middle class and the poor."
While the late 1980s were dominated by inflation, the period around 2001 was a more full-blow economic and political crisis, which saw a revolving door of presidents and one, Fernando De la Rua, fleeing the presidential palace by helicopter amid riots.
Argentina recently saw some scattered looting of shops and supermarkets, with over 100 arrests, though that has calmed down in recent days.
"The issue of looting and everything that has been happening these days hits me badly because I lived through 2001, which was very ugly," said retiree Jorge Del Teso, 68, who has three daughters and previous worked in finance.
"People are just fed up with politics."

Headline: Archaeologists find 'mystery' ducts near biblical Jerusalem relics
Article Content:
Remnants of an ancient channel network of hewn-rock ducts which the Israel Antiquities Authority says were in use around 2,800 years ago have baffled archaeologists who cannot ascertain their purpose given the lack of comparable biblical finds or obvious links to an ancient Jewish temple and palace that once stood nearby, in Jerusalem, August  Acquire Licensing Rights Read more
JERUSALEM, Aug 30 (Reuters) - An almost three millennia-old network of hewn-rock ducts unearthed in Jerusalem has baffled archaeologists, given the lack of comparable biblical finds, or obvious links to an ancient Jewish temple and palace that once stood nearby.
The knee-deep channels, dating back 2,800 years, are located outside Jerusalem's walled Old City. They stand in two clusters, which were discovered 10 metres (30 feet) apart.
Forensic testing of the channels found no blood, the Israel Antiquities Authority said - potentially ruling out a role in animal slaughter for banquets or religious sacrifice.
The ducts also do not appear to have engineered a flow in a single direction, or debouched into any basin, suggesting they were not used to sluice out sewage or rainfall, added the authority, whose research partner is Tel Aviv University.
"We looked at the installation and realised that we had stumbled on something unique," said archaeologist Yiftah Shalev in a joint statement, dubbing the discovery a "mystery".
The channels may have been used to prepare a commodity "connected to the economy of the temple or palace", said archaeologist Yuval Gadot in the statement.
"The production of linen, for example, requires soaking the flax for a long time to soften it. Another possibility is that the channels held dates that were left out to be heated by the sun to produce silan (date honey)," Gadot said.
The find, part of Israel's City of David National Park, will go on public display next week, the statement said.

Headline: California moves closer to historic caste discrimination ban

WASHINGTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - California moved closer to becoming the first U.S. state to ban caste discrimination after a bill to outlaw the practise passed the California Assembly late on Monday.
U.S. discrimination laws ban ancestry discrimination but do not explicitly ban casteism. California's legislation targets the caste system in South Asian immigrant communities by adding caste to the list of categories protected under the state's anti-discrimination laws.
The bill was introduced and authored by state Senator Aisha Wahab, an Afghan American Democrat, in March. An earlier version of it passed the state Senate before undergoing revisions.
The bill was passed on Monday by the state Assembly with a near unanimous vote. The revised version will now move back for a vote to the state Senate, where it is expected to pass, before heading to the desk of California Governor Gavin Newsom to be signed into law.
Activists opposing caste discrimination say it is no different from other forms of discrimination like racism and hence should be outlawed.
The movement to fight the caste system in North America has picked up energy in recent months.
Earlier this year, Seattle became the first U.S. city to outlaw caste discrimination after a city council vote and Toronto's school board became the first in Canada to recognize that caste discrimination existed in the city's schools.
The issue is particularly important to Americans of Indian descent and Hindus.
The caste system is among the world's oldest forms of rigid social stratification. It dates back thousands of years and allows many privileges to upper castes but represses lower castes. The Dalit community is on the lowest rung of the Hindu caste system; members have been treated as "untouchables."
India outlawed caste discrimination over 70 years ago, yet several studies in recent years show that bias persists. One study found people from lower castes were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs.
Dalits still face widespread abuse across India, where their attempts at upward social mobility have at times been violently put down.
Debate over the caste system in India and abroad is contentious and intertwined with religion. Some people say discrimination is now rare, especially outside India. Indian government policies reserving seats for lower-caste students at top Indian universities have helped many land tech jobs in the West in recent years.

Headline: Tennessee governor's push for gun laws fails as lawmakers scuffle

Aug 29 (Reuters) - A special legislative session in Tennessee called by the state's Republican governor in response to a deadly school shooting ended on Tuesday with no progress on gun safety laws, capped by a brief scuffle between opposing lawmakers.
Governor Bill Lee, in the special session which opened on Aug. 21, asked lawmakers to consider a "red flag" law and a number of other public safety measures he pitched in the wake of the murder of three children and three staff members at The Covenant School in March in Nashville.
But fellow Republicans, who hold a supermajority in the state legislature, would not budge on their refusal to pass any laws they deem as threats to citizens' right to own guns under the U.S. Constitution.
Two Democratic lawmakers who had reclaimed their seats after being expelled over a protest from the House of Representatives floor against gun violence in April confronted House Speaker Cameron Sexton as Republicans voted to end the special session on Tuesday.
A brief scuffle between the two Democrats, Representatives Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, and the Republican speaker broke out, with shoves exchanged before other members stepped in to separate them.
Jones and Pearson, both of whom are Black members of the predominantly white House, have been outspoken proponents of new gun laws to help ease violence in the urban areas they represent.
After being expelled by Republicans from their seats in April, Jones and Pearson won back their seats in a special election.
Lawmakers did set aside extra funds for existing safety programs, prompting Lee, the governor, to say that "our state is safer today as a result of this session."
That sentiment was not shared by Sarah Shoop Neuman, the parent of a Covenant student who lobbied lawmakers for new gun laws. After the session ended, she told reporters it was difficult for her to comprehend that children were murdered at school, yet lawmakers "took no meaningful action."

Headline: In Japan, a third of today's 18-year-old women may not have children - study

TOKYO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - About a third of 18-year-old women in Japan may never have children, a government institute said on Wednesday, in the latest data spelling an uphill battle to reverse a dwindling population in the world's third-largest economy.
The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (IPSS) estimated in a report that 33.4% of women born in 2005 would be childless. The most optimistic scenario had that number at 24.6% and the worst at 42%.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in June promised to tackle the population crisis with "unprecedented" measures including bigger payouts for families with three or more children.
A Kyodo News poll published shortly after, however, showed that about two-thirds of the public were not hopeful the policies would be effective.
"With the rising cost of living, I don't think people feel they can afford to or comfortably say they want to have children," 23-year-old Anna Tanaka told Reuters.
The number of children in Japan has been falling for more than four decades as the appetite for marriage and parenting has waned and financial worries have grown, surveys show.
The IPSS determines the expected percentage of childless women by taking into account factors such as age of marriage in estimating the fertility rate.
Miho Iwasawa, the IPSS's director of population dynamics research, said people were getting married later, leading to a decline in births.
In 2020, women got married for the first time at an average age of 29.4, or 3.9 years later than in 1985, government data shows. Marrying in one's late-30s often results in just one child, if any, Iwasawa said.
That trend could itself be causing a vicious cycle of fewer children begetting fewer children, said Takuya Hoshino, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
As people have fewer children, they are able to spend more on each child than families have in the past. That drives up the average cost of raising a child for the broader population, putting some people off from having children, he said.
Tuition at private universities jumped five-fold between 1975 and 2021, and by 19 times at public universities, data shows.
"The challenge is that no single cause can be identified for the declining birthrate," Iwasawa said.
Japan's population of 126.15 million in 2020 is projected to fall to 87 million by 2070, IPSS said.

Headline: Australia sets October date for historic vote on Indigenous recognition
Article Content:
SYDNEY, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Australians will vote on October 14 on whether they want to change the constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait island people, a defining moment in the struggle for Indigenous rights in the country.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the date for the landmark referendum in Adelaide on Wednesday, describing it as a once-in-a-generation chance to unite the nation.
"​​October 14 is our time...it’s our chance," Albanese told a cheering crowd.
"It’s a moment calling out to the best of our Australian character. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people this has been a marathon. For all of us, it is now a sprint."
Australians will now face a six-week campaign before voting in the referendum, where they would be asked whether they support altering the constitution to include a "Voice to Parliament", an Indigenous committee to advise federal parliament on matters affecting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people.
Any change to Australia's constitution requires a national referendum.
Australia is a global laggard on relations with its Indigenous people, in comparison to many other developed nations including Canada, New Zealand, EU nations and the U.S.
It has no treaty with its Indigenous people, who make up about 3.2% of its near 26 million population and track below national averages on most socio-economic measures.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people are not mentioned in Australia's constitution despite inhabiting the land for over 65,000 years.
Pat Anderson, an Aboriginal woman who is co-leading the campaign for the change, said a majority of Aboriginal people support the Voice to Parliament because they know it will improve outcomes.
"Between now and referendum day, we ask everyone to remember that we as First Nations Peoples know what works best for our communities and we believe that a Voice will finally be the step to improve our peoples’ lives," she said in a statement.
Opposition Liberal party leader for Indigenous affairs, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price said the Voice to Parliament was an "elite proposal" that would divide the country.
"It is that old rule of divide and conquer that I can't stand for," she said in a news conference aired on TV.
The government has staked significant political capital on the referendum's success, and top sporting codes, major corporations, faith-based groups and welfare groups support the campaign.

But public debate on the issue has been divisive, and support for the proposal has dipped in recent months, according to opinion polls.
Backers argue voting yes will help mend fraught ties with the Aboriginal community and unite the nation, and the advisory body will help prioritise Indigenous health, education, employment and housing.
Some opponents, however, argue the move would divide Australians along racial lines and hand excessive power to the Indigenous body. Others have described the Voice as a symbolic and toothless body.
The plans failed to secure bipartisan support, with the conservative opposition Liberal Party saying it will campaign to vote "No" in the referendum.
Some senior Liberal party leaders, however, have broken ranks and supported the Voice referendum.
Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, whose government rejected the Voice to Parliament in 2017, says he now supports the plans.
"The Voice delivers recognition and respect to Indigenous Australians in the manner they have sought," Turnbull said in an opinion piece in The Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday.
"On October 14, together we can bend the arc of history a little further towards justice by voting YES," he said.
Referendums in Australia need to surpass a high bar of 'double majority' to be successful. This means it must be backed by more than 50% of voters nationwide, and supported by a majority of voters in at least four of the six states.
In the past there have been 44 proposals for constitutional change in 19 referendums, and only eight of these have passed, the last in 1977.
In the most recent referendum in 1999, Australians voted against changing the constitution to establish Australia as a republic.
Campaigners supporting the change launched campaigns across the country, talking to people and offering more information about the proposal.
"I’m just trying to vote yes for the recognition of the real owners of Australia," Sydney resident Oscar Rodas, who was at one of the campaigns, told Reuters.
"Hope everybody just do the same, but it’s going to be really tough election, the referendum.”

Headline: Lithuania summons Pope's diplomat over remarks on Russian empire heritage

VILNIUS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Majority-Catholic EU member Lithuania has summoned the Vatican's top diplomat in the country after Pope Francis told Russian youths to remember they are the heirs of "the great Russian empire".
In response to the impromptu remarks Francis made on Friday in a live video address to Catholic youths gathered in St. Petersburg, the Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Ministry invited the Apostolic Nuncio for "a talk" after the archbishop returns from holidays, a ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.
The Vatican said on Tuesday Pope Francis did not intend to glorify Russian imperialism in the speech, in which he also extolled Russian emperors Peter the Great and Catherine II who expanded the Russian empire.
The territories of Lithuania and Poland were annexed into the Russian empire in the 18th century by Catherine II. The countries broke away after World War I, after two 19th century revolts against the empire were brutally suppressed.
Francis' intent was "to preserve and promote all that is positive in the great Russian cultural and spiritual heritage", said Vatican.
Ukraine, once part of the same empire, said the comments were "deeply regrettable". The Kremlin described them as "very gratifying".
Lithuania, a nation of 2.8 million where three quarters identify as Roman Catholics, has been a staunch critic of Russia and supporter of Ukraine in both the European Union and NATO.
The Catholic Church is still revered in the country for its anti-Communist, pro-independence stance while it was under Soviet Union annexation. During the period, the Vatican kept Lithuanian diplomatic representation to the Holy See as it did not recognize the annexation.
Francis celebrated a mass to a crowd of an estimated 100 thousand in Lithuania when he visited in 2018.
