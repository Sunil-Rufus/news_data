Watch: Fire after Russian airport drone attack, says governor
Moscow has vowed Ukraine will "not go unpunished" after drone strikes hit targets in Russia, while Kyiv saw its heaviest bombardment in months.
The drones hit several Russian regions and damaged two military planes, a fuel depot and a microelectronics factory.
Meanwhile Ukrainian officials said most missiles and drones were shot down but two people were killed.
Kyiv has not said that it was involved in the latest attacks, but it rarely comments on strikes inside Russia.
In recent weeks, however, Ukraine is believed to have increased its use of explosive drones to attack targets in Russia.
This is all part of its counter-offensive strategy - making it as difficult as possible for Russia to keep its frontline troops supplied, as it pushes on with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
At a regional airport in Pskov, a western city that lies some 600km (372 miles) from Ukraine, two military planes were struck and burst into flames according Russian news agencies.
The regional governor, Mikhail Vedernikov, said that he was at the scene and posted a video on Telegram showing a large fire, while an explosion could be heard.
The damaged aircraft - Ilyushin 76 - are long range cargo planes, that are ideal for transporting troops and equipment over long distances. Pskov airport, which was closed to its select few civilian flights on Wednesday, also serves as an important military hub.
They are valuable war assets to Russia, and that makes them targets for Ukraine.
It was the second drone attack in as many months in Pskov - there was another strike in the region in May.
There were more attacks further south, with the Russian military saying it shot down Ukrainian drones in the Bryansk, Kaluga, Oryol and Ryazan regions, plus one near the Crimean city of Sevastopol.
Bryansk's regional governor, Aleksandr Bogomaz, said one was intercepted en route to destroying a TV tower, while another hit a microelectronics factory, where components for Russia's weapons systems were made.
A fuel depot in Kaulga was also hit - yet another logistical target involved in keeping Russia's war machine rolling.
Ukraine's plan to fight back against Russia's invasion has been described as "starve, stretch and strike" by the UK's Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin.
Kyiv hopes that this strategy of targeting key infrastructure - as well as long-range artillery and missile strikes well behind Russia's front lines in southern Ukraine - will help Ukrainian forces to push though those lines and achieve some measure of success before the end of the year.

Missile debris rains down from the Kyiv night sky
In Ukraine's capital Kyiv, meanwhile, night time footage showed balls of fire flying through the night sky and exploding.
General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said there were 44 Russian strikes in total - 28 missiles and 16 drone attacks. He said all except one drone were intercepted.
The two people who died were security guards in the city's Shevchenkivskiy district, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.
Cruise missile debris was scattered across a park north-west of the city centre, and authorities were at the scene investigating the wreckage on Wednesday.
The air attacks in Russia are the latest in a spate of strikes deep inside its territory.
Last week, three people were killed in the Belgorod region hours after a drone hit central Moscow, Russian officials said.
And around the same time, a Russian long-range bomber was destroyed in a Ukrainian drone strike at an airbase south of St Petersburg.
President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an "inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process" as the war with Russia continues.

Headline: Australia to hold historic referendum in October
Article Content:
Australians will vote in a historic referendum on 14 October to decide whether to enact an Indigenous Voice to Parliament.
If approved, the vote would recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the country's constitution, and establish a permanent body for them to give advice on laws.
The proposal is the subject of fierce debate in Australia.
The country has not had a successful referendum in almost 50 years.
For it to succeed, a majority of Australians need to vote yes. There also needs to be majority support in at least four of Australia's six states.
The composition, functions and powers of the body - whose advice would not be binding - would then be designed and debated by the parliament.
Announcing the poll date at a rally in Adelaide, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the vote "a once-in-a-generation chance to bring our country together and to change it for the better".
The Voice would be "a committee of Indigenous Australians, chosen by Indigenous Australians, giving advice to government so that we can get a better result for Indigenous Australians", he said.
"You're being asked... to say yes to an idea whose time has come - to say yes to an invitation that comes directly from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves."
It was recommended by a historic document in 2017 called the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Drafted by more than 250 Indigenous leaders, the statement is considered the best - though not unanimous - call to action for reforms which affect First Nations Australians.
Australia is the only Commonwealth country that has never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people, and advocates say the Voice is an important step towards reconciliation.
Indigenous Australians face disproportionate levels of disadvantage across society - something Australia has long struggled to address.
Opposition leader Peter Dutton, a Voice opponent, says there it not enough detail behind the proposal, and controversially asserts it could racially divide Australians.
But many No campaigners - including Mr Dutton - have been accused of race-baiting and spreading disinformation.
They have in turn accused the Yes campaign of elitism and of dismissing valid concerns of everyday Australians.
Mental health advocates have warned the intensity and tone of the debate is taking a toll on Indigenous people.
Australia last held a referendum in 1999, when it opted not to become a republic.
Only eight of Australia's 44 referendums have been successful - the most recent in 1977. None have passed without bipartisan support.

Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ate "very delicious" fish sashimi from Fukushima, in a video released by the Japanese government.
It follows a row over the discharge into the sea of treated radioactive wastewater from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown.
The United Nations atomic energy regulator says the discharge of filtered water into the Pacific Ocean is safe and will have "negligible" impact on people and the environment.
But China, the leading buyer of Japan's fish, announced on Thursday it was making a total ban on its seafood products, due to concerns for consumers' health.

Headline: Burger King faces legal claim over size of Whopper
Article Content:
Burger King must face a lawsuit that alleges it makes its Whopper burger appear larger on its menus than it is in reality, a US judge has ruled.
The lawsuit accuses the fast food giant of misleading customers by showing the burger with a meatier patty and ingredients that "overflow over the bun".
"The plaintiffs' claims are false," Burger King told the BBC.
Rivals McDonald's and Wendy's are facing a similar lawsuit in the US.
The class action lawsuit against Burger King alleged that the Whopper was made to look 35% larger, with more than double the amount of meat compared to what was actually served to customers.
Burger King had earlier argued that it was not required to deliver burgers that look "exactly like the picture".
In the ruling, US District Judge Roy Altman said it should be left to jurors to "tell us what reasonable people think".
However, he dismissed claims that Burger King misled customers with its television and online advertisements.
"The flame-grilled beef patties portrayed in our advertising are the same patties used in the millions of Whopper sandwiches we serve to guests nationwide," a Burger King spokesperson said in a statement after the ruling.
Lawyer Anthony Russo, who represents the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
Have you ever been disappointed by a food item you've ordered? Get in touch.
The Burger King website describes the Whopper as "the burger to rule them all", that contains a "real meaty" beef patty, and other ingredients.
Other fast food chains have recently faced legal challenges over claims of false advertising.
Earlier this year, Taco Bell was sued in the US for selling pizzas and wraps that allegedly contained half the filling that was advertised.
Last year, a man in New York proposed a class-action lawsuit against McDonald's and Wendy's, in which he accused the two companies of unfair and deceptive trade practices.
The lawsuit alleged that McDonald's and Wendy's burgers in marketing materials were at least 15% larger than they were in real life.

Headline: Former BBC boss Mark Thompson named head of CNN
Article Content:
Ex-BBC and New York Times boss Sir Mark Thompson has been appointed to lead CNN following a series of crises and falling ratings at the US news network.
Sir Mark replaces Chris Licht, who struggled to stabilise CNN in his 13 months as chairman and CEO.
The network has also been through the firings of star anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon, and the closure of streaming service CNN+ after just one month.
Sir Mark must also guide CNN during the 2024 US presidential election.
That challenge will coincide with coverage of criminal charges against Donald Trump.
The network has had a famously tempestuous relationship with the former US president, who unsuccessfully tried to sue CNN for defamation, claiming it had created a "false and incendiary association" between him and Adolf Hitler following the last election.
A CNN interview with Mr Trump in May was widely criticised, including by the network's own Christiane Amanpour. Mr Licht stepped down weeks later.
CNN's previous boss Jeff Zucker had been forced to resign in February 2022 after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a senior executive.
David Zaslav, chief executive of parent company Warner Bros Discovery, described Sir Mark as "a formidable force for CNN and journalism at this pivotal time".
He added: "Mark is a true innovator who has transformed for the digital age two of the world's most respected news organizations."
The British executive was director general of the BBC from 2004 to 2012, and is credited with reviving the fortunes of the New York Times by boosting digital subscriptions as president and CEO from 2012 to 2020.
"I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and get down to work with my new colleagues to build a successful future for CNN," Sir Mark said.
His appointment comes days after Warner Bros Discovery announced a new attempt at launching a CNN streaming service, CNN Max, which will combine existing shows with online-only programming.
CNN's cable TV ratings have been dropping faster than those of its competitors, according to official figures quoted by the Associated Press earlier this year.

The British executive was director general of the BBC from 2004 to 2012, and is credited with reviving the fortunes of the New York Times by boosting digital subscriptions as president and CEO from 2012 to 2020.
"I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and get down to work with my new colleagues to build a successful future for CNN," Sir Mark said.
His appointment comes days after Warner Bros Discovery announced a new attempt at launching a CNN streaming service, CNN Max, which will combine existing shows with online-only programming.
CNN's cable TV ratings have been dropping faster than those of its competitors, according to official figures quoted by the Associated Press earlier this year.

Headline: Canada warns LGBT travellers of US risks
Article Content:
Canada has issued a new travel warning to its LGBT citizens planning to visit the United States.
Anti-LGBT protests in the US rose 30-fold last year compared with 2017, while legal moves to restrict LGBT rights are on the rise.
Global Affairs Canada warned that some state laws may affect them on their travels, but did not specify where.
Such warnings are usually reserved for countries such as Uganda, Russia or Egypt.
"Some states have enacted laws and policies that may affect 2SLGBTQI+ persons. Check relevant state and local laws," reads its US travel advice page.
The term 2SLGBTQI+ is widely used in Canada for people who consider themselves two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning or intersex.
A spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada pointed to US laws targeting the transgender community.
"Since the beginning of 2023, certain states in the US have passed laws banning drag shows and restricting the transgender community from access to gender-affirming care and from participation in sporting events," they told CBC News.
In March, Tennessee's governor signed laws banning drag performances in front of children and restricting medical treatment for transgender youth.
Two months later, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed bills banning children from undergoing transgender medical treatments or going to drag shows, and restricting pronoun use in classrooms.
Hundreds of similar regulations on LGBT issues have been proposed in conservative-run states across the US.
The Human Rights Campaign, the LGBT community's largest advocacy group in the US, said in June that LGBT Americans were facing a state of emergency as states continue targeting them with legislation.
On Monday, a mural in Florida dedicated to Belfast-born journalist Lyra McKee, who was shot dead in 2019, was defaced with a swastika and anti-LGBT graffiti.
Asked why the guidance had been updated, Canadian Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland told reporters in Atlantic Canada that the government employed experts "to look carefully around the world and to monitor whether there are particular dangers to particular groups of Canadians".
She declined to comment when asked whether there had been discussions with the US government before making the change.

Headline: Cut-outs and mimicry to deter Delhi monkeys at G20
Article Content:
Authorities in India's capital, Delhi, are taking steps to scare away monkeys from venues linked to the G20 summit.
Life-size cut-outs of grey langur monkeys - which scare smaller monkeys - have been put up at various places and there are plans to deploy people trained to mimic the animal's sounds.
Delhi has a huge monkey population and authorities hope these steps will keep the animals from disrupting the summit.
India will host the meeting of G20 leaders on 9 and 10 September.
Langurs are an aggressive type of monkey with long tails and dark faces. They are typically controlled on leads by specially trained handlers, who release them once other monkeys are seen.
A senior official told PTI news agency that langur cut-outs were being placed in areas heavily infested with monkeys.
Satish Upadhyay said that 30-40 trained people who can mimic sounds made by langurs will be deployed at hotels where delegates are set to stay, as well as in places where monkey sightings are reported.
Authorities are also making arrangements to provide food for monkeys in designated sites, aiming to discourage them from lingering in search of food.
On previous occasions too - including the 2010 Commonwealth Games - authorities in Delhi have tried to scare away monkeys with the help of real langurs or people who can mimic them.
In 2014, authorities hired 40 professional langur impersonators to scare away monkeys from the parliament and other government buildings in the capital.
Parliament authorities had earlier used real langurs for the same purpose, but stopped after animal rights activists said holding monkeys captive amounted to cruelty.

Headline: Coffee misses bagel - dating app outage sparks heartache
Article Content:
Users of the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel have expressed frustration over an ongoing, multi-day system outage.
The CMB app - which sells itself as the one "for serious daters" - first went down on 27 August, blocking users from their budding romances.
It has now been down for three days with the firm's engineers saying they are working on a "system outage".
The app claims to have more than 10 million sign-ups worldwide, including many across Asia.
"I had a date set up for tonight before it went down. And now I'm drinking alone," one user in Singapore complained.
In a company update on Tuesday night local time, the firm said: "We're making solid progress, and we're on track to get things back up and running.
"We'll send you both an email and a push notification once things are fixed."
But frustrated users are venting their concern online. It's led to speculation of a ransomware attack, data compromises as well as jokes about employee sabotage.
"Maybe someone got ghosted and in revenge brought down CMB," read one comment on Reddit.
On its Instagram posts celebrating successful "CMB couples", users wrote: "Lucky they found each other before the ransomware attack."
Many are also genuinely upset about missed connections, expiring messages and concerns their matches - known on the app as "bagels"-  would think they were being stand-offish.
"This is affecting many people's ability to connect with people they've begun to develop relationships with," one top-liked comment read.
"RIP to the poor souls who scheduled dates yesterday and couldn't coordinate, who had meaningful conversations going and lost them."
Another Reddit user said he and his date had only communicated through the app and had been in the middle of a second date plan when it went down.
He says he then resorted to searching for his match on Google, and "finally" found her LinkedIn profile and messaged her there. "I felt like a creep," he wrote.
Meanwhile, others have been luckier. On the Chinese internet, one romantic posted the time and restaurant setting of the date she'd hoped for with her CMB connection - and her date saw the post on XiaoHongShu - China's version of Instagram. In a follow-up post, the pair confirmed they had met.
However, much of the criticism has also centred around the company's lack of information about the system failure.
"The status update isn't really sufficient. Can you please let us know if this outage is expected to last hours, or days more?" one user wrote.
"I really hope it's not a hack," another said. "I provided a copy of my passport when they asked for verification. Stupid, stupid, stupid."
Others said they would be deleting the app - "Back to Hinge and Bumble," one user wrote.
Coffee Meets Bagel was founded in San Francisco in 2011 by three sisters, Arum Kang, Dawoon Kang and Soo Kang.
The app tries to distinguish itself from other dating platforms through "curated" matches and in-depth profiles. It claims 90% of its users use the app with the intention of finding a long-term relationship.

Headline: Hundreds of thousands forced to scam in SE Asia: UN
Article Content:
A new UN report estimates that hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have been trafficked to Southeast Asia to run online scams.
At least 120,000 people in Myanmar, and another 100,000 in Cambodia, have been forced into working these scams.
Most victims are men from Asia, but some have come from further afield such as Africa and Latin America.
While the problem has existed for years, the UN report is the first comprehensive study of its scale.
As pandemic-related shutdowns saw millions of people stuck in their homes and spending more time online, they became ready targets for the masterminds of online fraud schemes, according to the report.
And while criminal gangs have traditionally preyed on less-educated people desperate to make a quick buck, they are now targeting victims with professional jobs, who often have graduate or even post-graduate degrees.
Many of these places where people are forced into cybercrime are in jurisdictions where governance and the rule of law are weak, and authority is contested, the report said.
"In continuing to call for justice for those who have been defrauded through online criminality, we must not forget that this complex phenomenon has two sets of victims," said the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.
The UN estimates that these scams centres generate billions of US dollars in revenue per year.
Various media outlets including the BBC have spoken extensively to people who have fallen victim to these criminal networks.
Often, they are lured by ads promising easy work and extravagant perks, then tricked into travelling to Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand.
Once they arrive, they are held prisoner and forced to work in online scam centres. Those who do not comply face threats to their safety. Many have been subject to torture and inhuman treatment.
Some networks also target people seeking love and romance - in what's often known as "pig-butchering" scams. In a tragic case last year, a 25-year-old Malaysian was tortured to death after he went to Bangkok to meet a "girlfriend" he had only spoken to online.
Instead, he was trafficked to Myanmar and forced to work for companies involved in online scams. In one of his last calls to his parents, he said he had been beaten up for allegedly faking illness. He died after being in intensive care for a month.
Existing regulations in many Southeast Asian countries often fall short of international standards and have "in large part" failed to respond adequately to how online scam operations have evolved since the pandemic, the UN said.
Pia Oberoi, a senior adviser on migration at the UN Human Rights Office, said many more cases had gone unreported because the victims face "stigma and shame" for the work they had been tricked into doing.
The report added that an appropriate response should "not merely [involve] addressing organised crime or enforcing border controls", but should provide protection and justice for these victims of trafficking.
Mr Türk called for governments to be resolute in  cracking down on these criminal networks.
"All affected states need to summon the political will to strengthen human rights and improve governance and the rule of law, including through serious and sustained efforts to tackle corruption," he said.

Headline: India protests at Chinese map claiming territory
Article Content:
India says it has lodged a "strong protest" with China over a new map that lays claim to its territory.
Indian media have reported that the map shows the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh and the disputed Aksai Chin plateau as China's territory.
It was released by China's ministry of natural resources on Monday.
"We reject these claims as they have no basis," India's foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.
He added that such steps by China "only complicate the resolution of the boundary question".
Beijing has not officially responded yet.
India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar also called China's claim "absurd".
"China has even in the past put out maps which claim the territories which are not China's, which belong to other countries. This is an old habit of theirs," he told TV channel NDTV on Tuesday.
India's protest comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on the sidelines of the Brics summit in South Africa. An Indian official said afterwards that the two countries had agreed to "intensify efforts at expeditious disengagement and de-escalation" along the disputed border.
India has often reacted angrily to China's attempts to stake claim to its territory.
The source of the tension between the neighbours is a disputed 3,440km (2,100 mile)-long de facto border along the Himalayas - called the Line of Actual Control, or LAC - which is poorly demarcated. The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps means the line can shift in places.
Soldiers on either side come face to face at many points, which can spark tensions - the last time being in December when Indian and Chinese troops clashed along the border in the town of Tawang.
China says it considers the whole of Arunachal Pradesh its territory, calling it "South Tibet" - a claim India firmly rejects. India claims the Aksai Chin plateau in the Himalayas, which is controlled by China.
In April, Delhi reacted sharply to China's attempts to rename 11 places in Arunachal Pradesh, saying the state would always be "an "integral and inalienable part of India".
Relations between India and China have worsened since 2020, when their troops were involved in a deadly clash at the Galwan valley in Ladakh - it was the first fatal confrontation between the two sides since 1975.

Headline: Russia’s kamikaze drones raining down on Ukraine
Article Content:
In Ukraine's north-east, Russia has recently deployed an estimated 100,000 troops in renewed attacks. But Quentin Sommerville, who spent the past month with Ukrainian brigades in the area, discovers it is the increasingly sophisticated drone attacks that are particularly feared.
The Serebrianskyi forest is alight. At first, it is only a hint on the breeze, the faint smell of wood smoke amid the pine trees. Three men of the 1st Special Purpose Bohun Brigade climb into an armoured Humvee, as the sound of artillery thumps ahead in the distance.
Earlier the brigade's press officer Taras had warned us: "It's like Verdun out there." A reference to the battlefields of World War One.
The sprawling forest lies to the east of the city of Lyman. Here, and stretching north to the city of Kupiansk, the Russians have made modest gains in recent weeks. The threat though, according to the commander of Ukraine's eastern forces, is considerable.
On social media last week, General Oleksandr Syrskyi warned that Russian forces were regrouping in the east. He claims Russia has marshalled 100,000 troops in the area and more than 900 tanks.

WATCH: Quentin Sommerville in the Humvee under attack
Russia is seeking to cement its control of the eastern regions where it has captured territory, much of which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in September last year. Moscow's stated war aim is the "liberation" of Donbas, which is made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. But with its greater manpower, it is attempting to also stretch Ukrainian resources, as Kyiv fights a separate offensive in the south of the country.
As the Humvee drives deeper into the woods, lumbering over dirt tracks, the trees are on fire - some burning where they stand, others now collapsed blackened trunks on the heavily cratered ground.
Dust and smoke billows into the vehicle from the gunner's turret. The battalion commander, who goes by the call sign "Speaker", sits forward in the passenger seat, his attention firmly fixed on the road ahead and the sky above - as much as the small cracked toughened windscreen will allow.
"This [damage] was an artillery strike this morning, maybe a couple of hours ago - you see it's still burning," he said.
Speaker has been fighting Russia and its proxies for years - starting in Donbas in 2014. His only break was a month in hospital after he was shot in the hand last September.
In the car, he barely says a word, and radio communications are kept to a minimum.
The earlier Russian rocket strikes have destroyed the tree canopy, laying bare the ground and road ahead. The troops are exposed, and the Humvee - and a pick-up truck leading in front - kick up great clouds of dirt and sand into the late morning air.
The driver - call sign "Accountant" - grips the steering wheel firmly as the Humvee's engine labours over dips and twists in the track. His helmet rolls around on the centre console, at the feet of the gunner - "Student" - who mans the 50-calibre gun with a cigarette hanging from his lips.
Some 40 minutes into the drive, a fireball explodes directly in front of the Humvee. Student drops down into the cab of the vehicle, and I ask if he's unhurt. He nods OK.
"A lot of drones," Speaker shouts from the passenger seat, cursing. "That was a drone attack against our car - Russian kamikaze drone," he says - referring to devices, guided by secondary surveillance drones, which can crash into targets with pinpoint accuracy.
Speaker continues: "They saw us from the top and then tried to attack. They saw us and now they are seeking us and hunting us. So we need to go fast and go back."
The drone hit the road between the Humvee and the lead pick-up truck, missing us by a metre. The dust cloud we were creating, which may have alerted the Russians to our position, also likely clouded their targeting.
Two drones were in the sky above, Speaker said. One for surveillance, the other to strike. As we head back down another dirt road, the blackened remains of another Humvee - its armour cracked wide open and its turret gone - lies by the roadside, the victim of an earlier attack.
A week ago, Speaker explains, one of their soldiers was killed and three injured when a kamikaze drone took out yet another of the battalion's vehicles.
Ukraine, which enjoyed an advantage in weaponised drones at the beginning of the conflict, is increasingly being challenged by advances in Russian drone tactics and technology. Russia now has drones which hunt in pairs, using laser targeting to hit their mark - an advance that many Ukrainian commanders along the front say is costing lives.
Back at his base, Speaker explains further. "In the last two weeks, drones are attacking more and more and more. Because the Russians, they're studying, they're educating their drone operators and it is… getting harder to fight them."
Soldiers, of course, have the advantage of armour. Civilians do not. And around Kupiansk - the city Ukraine recaptured last September - Russian guns are again shelling people's homes. Evacuation orders have been issued for dozens of towns and villages.
Helping get people to safety is Artur Vynohradov, a volunteer with the charity "I am Saved". The words are written across his T-shirt and have a double meaning. The group is made up of recovering addicts who drive their three battered vans to villages in danger. Since the war's start they say they have saved some 17,000 people. When we met earlier this month they'd brought out 300 people in the previous couple of days.
"We continue to take kids away," he said. "The priority for evacuation is kids."
In the back of one van is five-month-old Sofiia, cradled in the arms of her mother, Tetiana. Their neighbourhood was shelled that morning.
"It's very scary to live here. [I need to leave] in order to safeguard my children," she told me, kissing Sofiia's head as she slept.
Beside them in the now-packed van is her grandfather, who didn't give his name. "We counted 36 craters in the morning here after two incomings… A horrifying scene," he said. "I was sitting on the bed drinking coffee and suddenly ended up under the table. The [blast] wave threw me off the bed."
The people around here already lived under Russian occupation for six months, and many do not want to repeat it. Antonina Semenivna, 72, says she'll risk staying for now.
"Yesterday a bomb went off," she said. "We thought it sounded like an aeroplane but then there was a bang. If only [Ukraine's soldiers] could chase them away. But here they keep creeping and creeping and creeping."
Along the front, stretching from Lyman to Kupiansk, Russia's gains don't amount to much - yet.
But for Antonina and her neighbours, they mean everything. A repeat of war's tragedy, that again ends in the separation of Ukrainian families.

Headline: Nagorno-Karabakh: 'People are fainting in bread queues'
Article Content:
They call it the Road of Life, as it is the only route connecting 120,000 ethnic Armenians living in Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region with the Republic of Armenia.
But for nearly nine months the Lachin Corridor has been blocked by Azerbaijani authorities, resulting in severe shortages of food, medication, hygiene products and fuel in the breakaway region.
Eighteen-year old Hayk is standing on the balcony of a modest hotel in Goris on the Armenian side of the border with Azerbaijan, speaking to his mother on a video call.
"No eggs, no sugar, there are no sweets at all, bread is being rationed, got up at 04:00 the other day to stand in the queue," says his mother, speaking from the Karabakh town of Martakert.
Hayk is not his real name. I have changed it for his own safety.
Armenians are unable to reach their families on the other side of the Lachin Corridor because it has been blocked by Azerbaijan since December.
No independent media have been able to reach the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Photos and videos of empty shops have been circulating on social media.
"People are standing in queues for hours to get minimal food rations. People are fainting in the bread queues," local journalist Irina Hayrapetyan says in a recorded voice message from inside the ethnic Armenian enclave.
"We have no fuel for transport and people have to walk many kilometres by foot to stand in queues to buy whatever they can to feed their families."
Local authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh say one in three deaths is due to malnutrition.
"I know a case when a pregnant woman lost her child because there was no petrol to get her to hospital," says Hayk's mother.
She speaks of no gas since March, no fuel, no medication - not even shampoo - and regular power cuts. With winter coming it will get worse.
Her son feels hatred, fear and despair: "Because I understand sooner or later my home, my city, my country will be taken by Azerbaijan."
For Karabakh Armenians their home is Artsakh, a self-declared republic that does not exist on the world map, as this mountainous enclave is part of Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Despite having so much in common culturally, the two South Caucasus states of Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought for control of this land for decades in wars that have cost tens of thousands of lives.
In the most recent six-week war in 2020, Azerbaijan recaptured all the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh held by Armenia since 1994.
A ceasefire brokered by Russia relied on the deployment of Russian peacekeepers to guarantee the safety of ethnic Armenians and to control the Lachin Corridor, allowing for the free movement of people and goods between Karabakh and the Republic of Armenia.
But with Russia's focus on the war in Ukraine, Azerbaijan blocked the road to Nagorno-Karabakh's regional capital Stepanakert (known in Azerbaijan as Khandendi) with government-backed environmental activists last December.
In April, Azerbaijan installed its own military checkpoint at the entrance to the Lachin Corridor justifying its "sovereign right" and "full restoration of its territorial integrity". It accused Armenia of using the road to bring in military supplies, which Armenia denies.
The only international humanitarian organisations with access to Nagorno-Karabakh are the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the mine-clearance organisation, the Halo Trust.
The Halo Trust says it has been unable to deploy demining teams in recent weeks because its staff are too exhausted to work after queuing for bread all night and returning home empty-handed. It says halting operations in Martakert is particularly unfortunate as it has become a hub for people displaced by the war in 2020 - and they are now at risk of injury as well as malnutrition.
Although the Red Cross has been carrying out medical evacuations it has not been able to guarantee safe passage, as the Khachatryan family found out on 29 July.
That was the day 68-year-old Vagif Khachatryan was being transported to Armenia's capital Yerevan for urgent surgery for a heart condition.
"When they approached the Azerbaijani checkpoint, they said they needed to take him for 10 minutes to ask him a few questions," says his daughter Vera Khachatryan. "My father was taken away with a Red Cross employee; a few minutes later the Red Cross employee returned but my father was taken in an unknown direction."
Originally from Karabakh, she moved to the Armenian town of Jermuk after her village was returned to Azerbaijan as part of the ceasefire agreement.
"Now every minute, every second I am thinking: What if his heart stops?"
Azerbaijan's authorities have accused her father of war crimes committed during the First Karabakh war in 1992.
"There are a lot of eyewitnesses who recognise him through media reports. We never said war criminals shouldn't face justice," says Hikmet Hajiyev, special adviser to Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev.
Vera says the accusations are untrue. "Defending your country is not a crime. There cannot be a fair trial in Azerbaijan. Maybe there will be justice one day, but we don't have the time to wait for it."
Vagif Khachatryan's case has sent a shock wave among men in Nagorno-Karabakh. Three young Karabakh Armenian football players were detained this week at the same checkpoint for desecrating the Azerbaijani flag in 2021.
The fear now is that any ethnic Armenian male could face the same fate if they try to cross.
Vera's two other sisters remain in Karabakh under blockade.
"My sister's granddaughter is two months old, there is no baby formula, her mother does not have enough milk as she is not eating properly. There is no medicine for my 22-year-old nephew who was brain-damaged during the war, he lost his ability to speak and his right arm does not move."
This month the US called on Azerbaijan to restore free movement along the Lachin Corridor during an emergency UN Security Council meeting on the crisis.
The International Court of Justice had already told Azerbaijan it had a legally binding order to allow "unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo" on the road in both directions.
But Armenians are sceptical of the international community's commitment to resolve the crisis. Protesters in Yerevan have blocked the entrance to the UN office with food and sacks of flour to demand the road's reopening.
Azerbaijan denies a humanitarian crisis is unfolding. It says it wants full control of the territory, and has offered an alternative supply route via the town of Agdam, retaken during the 2020 war.
"Then afterwards the Lachin road will be opened in 24 hours as well. More roads are better for everybody," says the Azerbaijani president's special adviser.
Hikmet Hajiyev says Karabakh Armenians have been offered the same "linguistic, cultural, religious, including municipal rights" as Azerbaijani citizens.
But Armenia's ambassador at large, Edmon Marukyan, accuses Azerbaijan of making false promises when there is only one route connecting Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh. "They want to try and change the focus of the international community, to dissolve the understanding and obligation of the Lachin Corridor."
Former UN special rapporteur Gulnara Shahinian warns that severing the last link with the Republic of Armenia will spell annihilation for Karabakh Armenians. "You know what level of human rights violations occur in Azerbaijan. With their entire hatred policy, how could you expect that there would be a good attitude towards Armenians in Karabakh?"
A short drive from Goris, a mountain panorama offers a clear view of the current crisis.
On the Armenian side, nothing moves along a new road built to circumvent territory returned to Azerbaijan as part of the 2020 ceasefire agreement.
A line of lorries loaded with 400 tonnes of humanitarian aid for Karabakh, including food, medicine, baby formula and other essentials is parked along the approach to the Azerbaijani checkpoint.
Remembering the one thing Hayk's mother misses most is cooking oil, I ask a lorry driver waiting in Goris what he is transporting.
"Twenty-two tonnes of cooking oil."

Headline: What has India's rover been up to on the Moon?
Article Content:
Exactly a week ago, India set down a robotic probe on the Moon, becoming the first country to land near the lunar south pole.
Chandrayaan-3's Vikram lander - carrying a rover in its belly - touched down on the lunar soil after a 20-minute, nail-biting finale watched by millions of people across the world.
Hours later, the Pragyaan rover - Pragyaan is the Sanskrit word for wisdom - exited the lander and took its first steps on the Moon.
The Indian space agency has been providing regular updates on the rover's findings, the photos its taking, distance it is covering and how it is negotiating the obstacles in its path.
Here's a look at the highlights from the first week of the rover's Moonwalk:
Until now, we had only seen videos and images of the rover, taken by the lander.
But on Wednesday morning, Pragyaan turned its camera on its parent - the Vikram lander - and said, "Smile, please!"
The black-and-white image shows Vikram with all its six legs firmly planted on the lunar ground.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said this "image of the mission" was taken by the navigation camera onboard the rover.
Over the past few days, the rover has been hard at work.
On Tuesday evening, Isro said that a laser detector onboard had made "the first-ever in-situ - in the original space - measurements on the elemental composition of the surface near the south pole" and found a host of chemicals, including sulphur and oxygen, on lunar soil.
The instrument "unambiguously confirms" the presence of sulphur, it said, adding that preliminary analysis also "unveiled the presence of aluminium, calcium, iron, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon and oxygen".
"A thorough investigation regarding the presence of hydrogen is underway," it added.
Noah Petro, a project scientist at Nasa, told the BBC's Soutik Biswas that it's been known from the 1970s - from the Apollo and Luna samples - that sulphur is present in the lunar soil.
But he described Pragyaan's findings as "a tremendous accomplishment".
"I think Isro is highlighting that it's in-situ - so it's important to have measured sulphur on the lunar surface. Sulphur is a volatile element if it's not inside a mineral. So, if it's not part of a crystal, it's very cool to see it measured on the surface," he added.
As the rover roams around the mission's landing point - now named the Shiv Shakti Point - in what Isro has described as "the pursuit of lunar secrets", it has covered quite a distance. It has also had to change course to stay safe because of deep craters.
Two days after the landing, Isro said Pragyaan - which travels at a speed of 1cm per second - had "successfully traversed a distance of 8 metres (26ft)".
It added that on Sunday, the rover had encountered a crater with a diameter of four metres. But it was spotted well on time - when Pragyaan was about three metres away.
"It was commanded to retrace the path. It's now safely heading on a new path," Isro added.
Photos released by the space agency show the crater and the footprints of the rover on the lunar soil - going forward and returning.
On Sunday, Isro said that they had received the first set of data about the temperatures on the lunar topsoil and up to the depth of 10cm below the surface from a probe onboard Vikram lander.
The probe - called the ChaSTE experiment, or Chandra's Surface Thermophysical Experiment - is fitted with 10 individual temperature sensors and has thrown up some interesting results.
A graphic posted on X (formerly Twitter) by Isro showed a sharp difference in temperatures just above and below the surface.

While the temperature on the surface was nearly 60C, it plummeted sharply below the surface, dropping to -10C at 80mm (just about 3 inches) below the ground.
An Isro scientist told the news agency PTI that he was "surprised" by the temperature fluctuation. "We all believed that the temperature could be somewhere around 20C to 30C on the surface but it is surprisingly higher than what we had expected," BH Darukesha said.
The Moon, however, is known for harbouring extreme temperatures - according to Nasa, daytime temperatures near the lunar equator reach a boiling 250F (120C), while night temperatures can plunge to -208F (-130C).
The Moon's poles, it says, are even colder - one crater near the north pole recorded -410F (-250C) which makes it the coldest temperature measured anywhere in the entire solar system. Equally cold temperatures have been recorded at some of the craters which remain permanently in the shadows in the south pole

Headline: Nine boats in 24 hours: At sea with Tunisia's coast guard

Tethered to a small speedboat and being towed towards us was the first of nine migrant boats we would encounter during our 24-hour patrol with the Tunisian coast guard.
More than 180 people were rescued, all wearing rubber rings, but no life jackets, from what is now the world's busiest migrant route into Europe.
Within half an hour of our departure from the Tunisian coastal city of Sfax and boarding the national coast guard patrol boat, the radar had intercepted its first signal.
Working in tandem with two speed boats, these smaller, more agile vessels were deployed first to find the migrant ship.
Once located, their captain was ordered to turn off the engine and submit to being towed back to the larger patrol vessel where six Tunisian coastguards stood ready to assist.
Sfax, which is less than 200km (124 miles) across the Mediterranean from the Italian island of Lampedusa, has long been a transit hub for sub-Saharan Africans wishing to travel illegally into Europe - as well as a network of smugglers seeking to profit from them.
Many migrants used to go by road to Libya, and from there catch a boat to Greece.
But last year, after the Libyan authorities deported thousands of them and intensified patrols along the coast, the preferred route for migrants wishing to travel to Europe switched to Tunisia.
In July, the European Commission offered to contribute $115m (£90m) towards Tunisian efforts to intensify its border controls, search-and-rescue operations and anti-smuggling initiatives.
The $115m is part of a larger aid package being offered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Tunisia has not yet agreed to the terms of how exactly the money should be spent.
The UN reported that in the first six months of this year, 54,049 people were picked up by the Italian or Tunisian coast guard - a figure close to double the number who attempted the crossing during the whole of 2022.
It has also been an exceptionally perilous start to the year with the loss of more than 2,000 lives, according to the UN.
The coast guards were met with a wave of anger as the 46 passengers began to disembark from the migrant boat that had been towed.
"Let me go to Italy," one man shouted. "I'll only try again," screamed another.
All hailing from Ivory Coast and Guinea, they told us it was their third and even fourth attempt to cross this stretch of sea.
Although we were allowed to witness everything that went on during the operation, the crew on board had been told not to answer any of our questions. Instead, their spokesman Hossam El-Din El-Jababli, spoke to us once we were back at the port.
"There are those who threaten to throw themselves back overboard. To even pour petrol over themselves and set it alight," said Mr El-Jababli.
After releasing all the passengers back onto Tunisian soil, the radar soon detected another boat.
The two speed boats were sent to investigate.
As the second makeshift metal boat of the day pulled alongside us, all 20 people on board began begging for food and water. They tell us they have been adrift for more than 12 hours.
The passengers, from Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Syria, described fleeing from war zones before ending up in Tunisia. Unlike the first boat, this group appeared deeply traumatised and exhausted.
Returning to the shore, their captain was arrested by the Tunisian authorities. Charged with human trafficking, he could face a long prison sentence if found guilty.
As for the rest of the passengers, after having their details checked by the authorities, they were free to go - no doubt to try again.
Smugglers' prices for a place on the boat hugely vary depending on the migrant's nationality, the quality of the vessel and the time of year.
During these past summer months, prices reported in Sfax have ranged from 1,200 Tunisian dinars ($385; £300) to 6,500 Tunisian dinars ($2,100; £1,640). Those only able to pay the lower price are offered the most unstable vessels.
But with every coast guard interception and failed attempt, many migrants fall into a spiral of debt. They pledge to try one more time, to take one more loan. Only to fail again and sink deeper into poverty.
Sailing back out into the channel, a dozen items of clothes and shoes were seen floating in the water. Even the crew fell silent as we passed by.
Speaking to the BBC, the city's health director, Hatem Al-Sharif, said more than 700 unidentified people, including young children, have been buried in unmarked graves on the outskirts of Sfax since the beginning of this year.
Some blame Tunisian smugglers who, along this section of the coast, are known for using worn-out, unsuitable metal boats.
We saw dozens of these vessels, stacked high in a huge heap after being seized during a raid by the Tunisian authorities.
The local fishermen too said they were particularly wary of these boats as they are more prone to sinking and often splice their nets. They also described with much sadness what it felt like when they discovered a body, especially when it is a child.
"I've seen a lot of dead bodies. I don't want the migrants to continue making this journey. Our coastline has become a cemetery," said Al-Jilani Kamel, a fisherman.
Over the course of the next hour, we watched as the crew worked tirelessly, intercepting five more migrant boats.
Then just as their shift was coming to a close, there was a final call. This time, it concerned a boat full of their own compatriots.
Tunisians make up fewer than 15% of those trying to cross from the country into Europe. But as we saw, their anguish was no less intense.
As we pulled alongside their vessel, one Tunisian man stood up and began threatening to throw his young daughter overboard - for which he was later arrested.
Another screamed this was his fourth attempt. "It's as if I'm already dead," he cried out.
As we disembarked for the final time and began driving away from the port, dozens of migrants were walking along the side of the road after being released by the coast guard.
"We will probably spend the night here in these olive groves," said Abubakr, from Ivory Coast.
"And then we will try again," said another young man.
Asked if they were afraid of dying while trying to cross, a Sudanese man, Adel Adbullah, said: "I fled from war. I don't think I will see any worse at sea than I already have. I have nothing to lose."

Headline: What's behind Netflix's expansion into gaming?
Article Content:
Think of Netflix and a memorable television show or movie will likely pop into your mind.
What did you most enjoy? Squid Game? Bridgerton? Stranger Things maybe?
Soon, the streaming service wants video games to be competing for a place on that list.
Netflix says games are a key part of its proposition to stay relevant with audiences in years to come, and is slowly ramping up plans to offer more gaming experiences to subscribers.
Leanne Loombe, vice president of external games at Netflix, tells BBC News: "Games are one of the biggest forms of entertainment out there today, so it really is just a natural extension for Netflix to include them as part of the subscription.
"The lines between the different ways we enjoy our entertainment are blurring. When you're in that moment, looking to sit and watch a movie or be more active and play a game, we want to make sure we have something for you.
"Our goal is to have a game on the service for everyone. Not focus on making one big experience, but rather a selection of titles that members can choose to play."
Since November 2021 games have been available to play on the Netflix app, but this development passed many users by. Loombe says the streaming service has deliberately not been "shouting from the rooftops" but instead taking their time to understand the market place first.
So far, what's being offered are mobile games, with some tied to famous Netflix franchises (like Stranger Things) and others independent of the service (like Reigns: Three Kingdoms).
Currently they're only available to play on mobile devices, although tests are under way to see how they could work on TVs and computers.
This low-key approach is a sensible move according to games journalist Shay Thompson, who explains the industry is "littered with the failed attempts" from legacy media brands to get into the world of gaming.
"When other mainstream entertainment organisations have tried to enter the game space they've really struggled," Thompson says. "I think it's often down to companies fundamentally misunderstanding what it is about games as a form of entertainment that make them so compelling to players.
"Amazon Games is an example of this, they've had titles like Lost Ark and and Crucible with big budgets but those titles lacked the creativity and uniqueness that we've come to expect from the games space. That's a significant reason why those titles haven't ended up making a serious impact."
Experiences such as this and tech giant Google, who closed its Stadia console this year, show how difficult it is to find a place in the games space for companies.
Amazon's games division may not yet be as successful as its Prime Video operation, however we still expect to see more titles from them in future. The company is currently working on a the next iteration of the Tomb Raider franchise starring Lara Croft.
"Focusing on the mobile games first is a clever strategy that could work in Netflix favour," says Thompson. "It looks as if they're talking the time to understand the landscape and gamers. I know their reputation has been a bit shaky on the streaming side-recently, but it certainly seems like they're trying to work with the games space and not against it.
"However giving gamers what they want, not what a big organisations think they want, will be the key to making this work.  That is creativity and being unique."
In future, Loombe says we can expect to see Netflix leverage its intellectual property even more. "Connecting shows, movies and games together from our universes is what we're trying to accomplish," she explains.
In a trendy office space in central Liverpool, that's exactly what the team at Ripstone Studios are trying to do.
In amongst the exposed brick, succulent plants and pop culture memorabilia littered on the desks are developers and programmers busy creating the next update for their first partnership with Netflix. The Queen's Gambit is, as you may have guessed, a chess simulator based on the adventures of the television series' main character Beth Harmon.
The team won the contract to make the game after Jaime Brayshaw, the creative executive, sent Netflix an email out of the blue.
"I asked them when will Netflix become the Netflix of games?!" he laughs.
Ripstone, who have a long history of making chess games, became one of the first companies to partner with the streaming giant to work on their games offering.
Brayshaw says the relationship is not just a licensing agreement, but rather a "collaborative partnership" with both companies sharing expertise with each other.
As well as offering more content to Netflix customers in an increasingly competitive market, Brayshaw thinks their collaboration is a chance to help grow gaming as a form of entertainment as well: "Netflix has an audience 238 million people now," he says.
"Many of them will never have played a game before, so we had to think about designing one that is accessible to as many people as possible, even if they've never played a video game.
"Its exciting because it potentially allows more people to experience the joys of playing games and it could broaden the popularity of the medium."
Confident that this agreement is a "win-win", Brayshaw isn't worried about joining the long history of failed game and movie or television tie-ins.
"Yes there are lots of bad examples from yesteryear with tie-ins that are bad, but it's usually because there are timelines involved," he argues.
"Netflix has a more mature approach, where the products don't have to tie together at release, so fewer compromises are needed."
The streamer will be keen to learn from the other big media organisations renowned for working in film, television or tech who've tried to cross the divide into the games space.
Google's cloud gaming service Stadia was discontinued in January, while Amazon's games division has developed its own titles with mixed success.
It is currently working on a new Lara Croft game but none of its releases so far have challenged the popularity of titles like Fortnite or Call of Duty. There were redundancies at the studio earlier this year.
By focusing on mobile titles, which are cheaper to make than big console releases, there is less financial risk for Netflix. It isn't investing millions in one experience that has to compete with well established brands to be deemed a success.
Should a project fail to reach lots of players, the financial ramifications are not as significant.
However the other side of the coin is that in such a competitive space, if players are not impressed with what they're seeing, if they feel it lacks scope or ambition, they will very quickly move on to something else. It can be difficult to regain an audience that has moved on to other games.
This bottom-up approach is different to what we've seen before and we wont be able to judge its success for some time.
As Loombe reiterates: "We're very early in our games journey right now. When it's such a big industry like games, and there's already some fantastic titles out there in the market that players really love, we just want to make sure we were doing things in the right way."

Gabon's president Ali Bongo has appeared in a video that has been circulating on social media, calling for support from "friends all over the world" after being placed under house arrest.
The ousted leader is sitting in what he calls his residence - a grand room complete with wood-panelled walls, ornate carpets and leather-bound books.
Senior officers in Gabon's military had earlier appeared on national television, saying they had seized power of the country and that they will annul the results of an election in which President Bongo was declared the winner.
A company working for the presidency has told the BBC that the video of the president speaking is authentic.
