Headline: Top Russian general 'fired' after vanishing in wake of Wagner mutiny
Article Content:
A top Russian general who has been missing from public view since the Wagner mercenary rebellion has now been dismissed as head of the country’s aerospace forces, Russian state media reported Wednesday. It follows months of speculation about the fate of Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who had been the deputy commander of Russia’s forces in Ukraine but was known to have been close to mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin.“The ex-Commander-in-Chief of the Aerospace Forces of Russia Sergei Surovikin has now been relieved of his post, Colonel General Viktor Afzalov, Chief of the General Staff of the Aerospace Forces, is temporarily acting as Commander-in-Chief of the Aerospace Forces,” Russian state news agency RIA reported, citing a single unnamed source.Russian news outlet RBK and Rybar, a popular Telegram channel close to the country’s defense ministry, reported on Tuesday that Surovikin had been removed from his position. RBK reported, citing unnamed sources “familiar with personnel changes in the defense ministry,” that Surovikin was relieved of his duties due to a “transfer to another job,” and is currently “on a short leave.The Izvestia newspaper, known for its pro-Kremlin view reported what it said was Surovikin resignation from the post, citing its own unnamed sources. Alexei Venediktov, former head of the Ekho Moskvy, a prominent independent radio station that was shut down by authorities within days of the Ukraine invasion was the first to report that Surovikin had been dismissed on Tuesday, but said the general was being “retained by the defense ministry.”NBC News could not confirm the reports. There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin or Russian defense ministry. Surovikin has not been heard from publicly since Prigozhin’s short-lived mutiny against Russia’s military leadership earlier this summer. No official charges have been filed against Prigozhin and he appears to have been moving around the country freely. But this does not seem to have not been the case for Surovikin.Watch: Prigozhin's latest recruitment video for the Wagner mercenary groupAug. 22, 202300:43The general has not been seen in public since he appeared in a video urging Prigozhin to stand down in the early hours of the mutiny. Days after the rebellion, speculation swirled in Russian and foreign media that he had been detained on suspicion of aiding the rebels. Despite months of vitriol directed at Russia’s defense ministry, Prigozhin had on numerous occasions praised Surovikin as one of the only effective generals in the Russian army, and the two are considered close.Reuters and the New York Times both cited U.S. officials in the days after the mutiny saying that Surovikin was sympathetic to Prigozhin’s rebellion and may have even had “advance knowledge” of the mercenary chief’s plans. The reports were dismissed as “speculation and gossip” by the Kremlin at the time. The rumors about Surovikin’s arrest or any role in Prigozhin’s rebellion remained unconfirmed by Russia’s defense ministry or the Kremlin since then. His exact whereabouts remain unknown.Surovikin, 56, had earned the nickname “Gen. Armageddon” for his brutal tactics in the war in Syria, in which Russia has played a key part propping the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Surovikin was awarded the “Hero of Russia” title for his “courage and heroism” in Syria, according to the defense ministry profile of the general. He has commanded Russia’s Aerospace Forces since late 2017. Before that, he was the commander of Russia’s Eastern Military District, according to the ministry. Surovikin is widely considered one of the most effective and battle-hardened Russian generals. Last October, he was appointed as the overall commander of Russia’s forces in Ukraine amid growing criticism of Russia’s battlefield failures. He oversaw the aerial bombardment of Ukraine’s power grid infrastructure last fall, but was forced to withdraw from the key strategic city of Kherson just a month after his appointment. While many saw it as a defeat, some Kremlin hawks praised him for avoiding unnecessary personnel and equipment losses amid the inevitable liberation of the city by Ukrainian forces. Surovikin was replaced in this post by Gen. Valery Gerasimov in January, and was made one of Gerasimov’s deputies. Afzalov was previously deputy to Surovikin and has been chief of staff of the Aerospace Forces for at least four years, according to British military intelligence.During Surovikin’s absence from public view, Afzalov was shown on television briefing Gerasimov last month.

Headline: India makes historic uncrewed landing on the moon's south pole
Article Content:
India made history Wednesday by becoming the first country to reach the lunar south pole.An uncrewed robotic moon lander, operated by India’s space agency and known as the Chandrayaan-3, touched down on the moon’s south polar region shortly after 8:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.The Indian Space Research Organization’s successful touchdown comes just days after a Russian spacecraft that was en route to the same area failed during an orbital maneuver and crashed into the lunar surface. The failure was a major setback for Russia’s space agency, known as Roscosmos. People perform Hindu fire rituals as part of special prayers for the safe landing of the Chandrayaan-3 moon spacecraft, in New Delhi on Wednesday. Adnan Abidi / ReutersThe Chandrayaan-3 landing, however, is a huge boon for the world's most populous nation, which has been vying for greater influence in the cosmos, through both the government’s space agency and private investment. Only three other countries in history have pulled off controlled, or “soft,” lunar landings: the United States, China and the former Soviet Union.The moon’s south pole has long been of interest to space agencies and scientists because the region’s shadowed craters are thought to hold greater concentrations of water ice than elsewhere on the lunar surface, so it could be of critical importance for establishing long-term human settlements on the moon.NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon, intends to land its Artemis III mission in the south polar region in 2025.NASA Administrator Bill Nelson celebrated the landing in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.“And congratulations to #India on being the 4th country to successfully soft-land a spacecraft on the Moon,” he wrote. “We’re glad to be your partner on this mission!”India and Russia had been locked in a race to the lunar south pole. The Luna-25 spacecraft that crashed was the first moon-landing spacecraft launched by Russia’s space agency in almost five decades. Roscosmos officials said Sunday they lost contact with the lander after it fired its engines in preparation for a descent to the surface.A view of the moon as viewed by the Chandrayaan-3 lander during lunar orbit insertion Aug. 5 in this screen grab from a video released the next day. ISRO via Reuters fileThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is designed to conduct a series of science experiments on the surface, including tests of mineral composition and seismic activity. The lander, which is roughly the size of an SUV, is also carrying a smaller rover. Both solar-powered craft are designed to operate for about two weeks on the moon.The Chandrayaan-3, which launched into space July 14, was India’s second attempt to land at the moon’s south pole. A previous attempt in 2019 deployed a lunar orbiter, but the Chandrayaan-2 lander and rover crashed into the lunar surface.

Headline: Rappelling commandos and a 900-foot drop: How Pakistan rescued children dangling above a ravine
Article Content:
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Minutes after walking his teenage son to the cable car he takes to school Tuesday, Umraiz Khan said, he heard a loud noise followed by the sound of people screaming.Running back down to where he had left Irfan, 14, he said he saw the cable car dangling around 900 feet above the deep valley in the remote, mountainous region of Pakistan where they live. Two of its three cables had snapped. Its eight terrified passengers, seven of them schoolchildren between the ages of 9 and 15, were huddled inside, swinging at a 45-degree angle above the forests below.“It was a huge shock for me, as my son and his classmates were between life and death,” Khan told NBC News from his village of Jhangrai in Pakistan’s Battagram region, around 150 miles north of the capital, Islamabad.Three boys receive first aid after they were rescued from the stricken cable car. Nazir Mahood / APWhat followed was a gripping, 12-hour rescue mission watched by television audiences around the world, involving commandos rappelling from helicopters, high winds and the constant fear that the final cable would sever.“Don’t ask me how we got through those long hours,” Khan, who is in his 60s, said. “Helplessly looking at near and dear ones from the ground, you don’t know what will happen to them."Taking a cable car or chairlift to school or elsewhere isn’t uncommon in this part of Pakistan. Basic versions of this mode of transportation are used to bypass the winding roads and tracks that would take hours to traverse the majestic but impenetrable terrain.There have been similar accidents in the past, Amir Tareen, commissioner of the local Hazara region in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said after leading the “risky” mission. This car's cables snapped at 7 a.m. local time Tuesday (10 p.m. ET Monday), while the group was halfway across.Police officers and local volunteers take part in the rescue.Inter Services Public Relation / via APThe only adult among those trapped, Gul Faraz, 20, conveyed their terror in a phone call to local TV channel Geo News as the cable car was still swinging in the air. “Our situation is precarious, for God’s sake, do something,” he said.An estimated 8,000 people had gathered on the hillsides to watch the rescue operation, The Associated Press reported. The army was mobilized, and commandos rappelling from a helicopter tried several times to extract those inside the car. However, high winds made this more difficult, exacerbated by the powerful gusts from the helicopter’s own rotor blades.It was a painstaking operation, and finally just before sunset the helicopter managed to rescue one child — Irfan.The other seven were still stranded as night fell.Faraz later said he had no idea their perilous situation had garnered so much attention on TV.“We didn’t believe people in the entire world were watching us and praying for our safe rescue,” he said. “When we were passing through middle of the valley, one of the chairlift’s ropes broke down. The chairlift lost its balance and overturned and we thought it would fall down to the ground.”

“There was so much anxiety and the parents were so worried all day,” Tareen said.Rescues such as these are “very complicated, and it’s painful, but you have to take it slow,” said Thomas Coyne, a survival and emergency medical care instructor based in Irvine, California. “You have got to suck it up as the rescuer. You have got to realize we have to take it slow, because that will make for the best outcome.”Hampered by the darkness, the army switched to a different tactic: Constructing a pulley system and winching out the remaining survivors by hand, one by one. The AP reported it built this mechanism using a wooden bed frame.“At the end, when the helicopter operation could not go on in the dark, I think the rescuers made this brave decision because they didn’t want the kids to be waiting all night and the parents to be suffering from anxiety,” Tareen said.Remarkably there were no injuries, although one of the children fainted and was unconscious for a time.On Wednesday, police arrested Gul Zarin, the owner of the cable car, on charges of ignoring safety measures, police said.But the jubilation over the rescue's success matched the previous anxiety.“It was dangerous” but the successful result, made “the families very happy,” Tareen said. “Everyone got really excited when they saw the kids going to their parents.”Mushtaq Yusufzai reported from Peshawar, Pakistan, and Alexander Smith from London.
