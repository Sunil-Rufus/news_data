Headline: Russian mercenary Yevgeny Prigozhin's plane appeared fine on radar until last 30 seconds
Article Content:
Aug 23 (Reuters) - An Embraer (EMBR3.SA) Legacy 600 executive jet, believed to have carried Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to his death on Wednesday, showed no sign of problem until a precipitous drop in its final 30 seconds, according to flight-tracking data.
Rosaviatsia, Russia's aviation agency said Prigozhin, who led an aborted mutiny in June, was one of 10 people on board the downed plane. It was traveling from Moscow to St. Petersburg when it crashed near the village of Kuzhenkino in the Tver Region, Russia's emergency situations ministry said.
At 3:19 p.m. GMT, the aircraft made a “sudden downward vertical,” said Ian Petchenik of Flightradar24. Within about 30 seconds, the aircraft had plummeted more than 8,000 feet from its cruising altitude of 28,000 feet.
“Whatever happened, happened quickly,” Petchenik said.
“They may have been wrestling (with the aircraft) after whatever happened," Petchenik said. But prior to its dramatic drop, there was "no indication that there was anything wrong with this aircraft.”

Video showed the plane descending rapidly with its nose pointing almost straight downward and a plume of smoke or vapor behind it.
Russian investigators opened a criminal probe to determine what happened. Some unnamed sources told Russian media they believed the plane had been shot down by one or more surface-to-air missiles. Reuters could not confirm that.
Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) said it had not been providing any service or support in recent years to the plane, which seats around 13.
The company said in a statement it has complied with international sanctions imposed against Russia. The luxury jet was identified on Flightradar24 with registration RA-02795, the same as the plane that carried Prigozhin to Belarus after the mutiny, an industry source familiar with the matter said.
Online flight tracker Flightradar24 last recorded the position of the aircraft at 3:11 p.m. GMT, before the crash. Jamming or interference in the area probably slowed the collection of further location data.
Other data continued for nine minutes. Flightradar24 said the jet went thorough a series of ascents and descents of a few thousand feet each over 30 seconds before its final, disastrous plunge. Flightradar24 received its final data on the jet at 3:20 p.m.

Headline: US officials see missile strike, other theories, behind crash of Prigozhin plane

WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The United States is looking at a number of theories over what brought down the plane presumed to be carrying mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, including a surface-to-air missile hitting it, U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday.
Russian air authorities have said Prigozhin, his right-hand man Dmitry Utkin and eight other people were on the private plane that crashed with no survivors north of Moscow on Wednesday.
Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that it was likely a surface-to-air missile originating from inside Russia likely shot down the plane
The officials stressed that the information was still preliminary and under review, and did not rule out a change to the assessment.
The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported a different theory: that a bomb aboard the aircraft or some other sabotage caused the crash.
It is not uncommon for there to be competing, even contradictory, intelligence views in the U.S. government in the hours and days after major international events.
A third U.S. official told Reuters that there were a number of theories and no definitive conclusion had been reached.
The crash came two months to the day after Prigozhin and his Wagner mercenaries staged a mutiny in which they took control of a southern city and advanced towards Moscow, shooting down a number of Russian air force planes and killing their pilots.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he was not surprised by reports that Prigozhin had died in a plane crash, adding that not much happens in Russia that President Vladimir Putin was not behind.
Putin on Thursday said he wished to express sincere condolences to the families of those who died in the crash, and said it was necessary to await the outcome of the official investigation. Prigozhin, 62, head of the Wagner mercenary group, frequently criticized the Russian army top brass over what he said was its incompetent prosecution of the war in Ukraine.
The Embraer executive jet model that crashed in Russia had only recorded one accident in more than 20 years of service, and that was not related to mechanical failure.
While portraying it as a purely private commercial operation, the Kremlin has used Wagner to expand Russian influence on the continent in competition with Western powers such as France and the United States.
Prigozhin and a Russian company he controlled were indicted in 2018 and accused of funding a propaganda operation to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to sway it in favor of Republican candidate Donald Trump and to disparage rival Hillary Clinton.

Headline: Putin breaks silence on Wagner boss Prigozhin’s death
Article Content:
MOSCOW, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his condolences to the family of Yevgeny Prigozhin on Thursday, breaking his silence after the mercenary leader's plane crashed with no survivors two months after he led a mutiny against army chiefs.
Two U.S. officials told Reuters that Washington believed a  surface-to-air missile originating from inside Russia likely shot down the plane, though they said the information was preliminary and under review. They spoke on condition of anonymity and offered no evidence.
Russian investigators opened a criminal probe but there has been no official word from Moscow on what may have caused Wednesday evening's crash. Until Putin's comments there had been no official confirmation of Prigozhin's death beyond a statement from the aviation authority saying he was on board.
Breaking his silence, Putin described Prigozhin as a talented businessman whom he had known since the 1990s and said the investigation into the crash would take time.
Prigozhin, 62, was head of the Wagner mercenary group and a self-declared enemy of the army top brass over what he said was its incompetent prosecution of Russia's war in Ukraine.
Putin earlier made a virtual statement to a summit of the BRICS nations in South Africa which his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was attending. Neither referenced the plane crash in which 10 people were said to have been killed.
State media gave the disaster low-key coverage.

The Embraer Legacy 600 (EMBR3.SA) executive jet, which had been flying from Moscow to St. Petersburg and was reported to have also been carrying senior members of Prigozhin's team, crashed near the village of Kuzhenkino in the Tver region north of Moscow.
A Reuters reporter at the crash site on Thursday morning saw men carrying away black body bags on stretchers. Part of the plane's tail and other fragments lay on the ground near a wooded area where forensic investigators had erected a tent.
The Baza news outlet, which has good sources among law enforcement agencies, reported that investigators were focusing on a theory that one or two bombs may have been planted on board.
Prigozhin spearheaded the mutiny against the army leadership on June 23-24 which Putin said could have tipped Russia into civil war.
The mercenary leader also spent months criticising the conduct of Russia's war in Ukraine - which Moscow calls a "special military operation" - and had tried to topple Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff.
The mutiny was ended by an apparent Kremlin deal which saw Prigozhin agree to relocate to neighbouring Belarus. But he had appeared to move freely inside Russia.
Prigozhin posted a video address on Monday which he suggested was made in Africa. He turned up at a Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg in July.

Headline: Trump's debate counter-programming draws millions of views on X

LOS ANGELES, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump, who opted out of a Republican primary debate on Fox News (FOXA.O) on Wednesday, attracted millions of viewers who watched - or at least scrolled by - a rival interview on social media platform X.
The 46-minute conversation with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson drew more than 74 million views, according to statistics on the platform formerly known as Twitter.
It is unclear, however, how long visitors to the site watched the pre-recorded event. X view counts include anyone who scrolled past the video or watched for just a few seconds, as well as those who viewed the entire interview. Some viewers could be counted twice if they watched the video at different times or on different devices.
Carlson posted the interview just minutes before the debate began on Fox on Wednesday evening.
"We'll get bigger ratings using this crazy forum that you are using than probably the debate," Trump, who has sparred with Fox News over what he has called unflattering coverage, told Carlson.
Data on how many people watched the debate on Fox is expected to be released on Thursday.
Trump, who lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden, is the front-runner for the Republican nomination for president in 2024. Carlson is seeking to rebuild his audience after Fox News canceled his top-rated show in April following a damaging defamation lawsuit over false claims of election fraud.
He has been releasing regular interviews on X since June.
"I think it was a terrible move getting rid of you," Trump told Carlson.

Headline: BRICS welcomes new members in push to reshuffle world order
Article Content:
JOHANNESBURG, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The BRICS bloc of developing nations agreed on Thursday to admit Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates in a move aimed at accelerating its push to reshuffle a world order it sees as outdated.
The group's leaders left the door open to future enlargement, potentially paving the way for the admission of dozens more countries motivated by a desire to level a global playing field they consider rigged against them.
The expansion adds economic heft to BRICS, whose current members are China, the world's second largest economy, as well as Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa. It could also amplify its declared ambition to become a champion of the Global South.
But long-standing tensions could linger between members who want to forge the grouping into a counterweight to the West - notably China and Russia - and those that continue to nurture close ties to the United States and Europe.
"This membership expansion is historic," Chinese President Xi Jinping, the bloc's most stalwart proponent of enlargement, said. "It shows the determination of BRICS countries for unity and cooperation with the broader developing countries."
Originally an acronym coined by Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill in 2001, the bloc was founded as an informal four-nation club in 2009 and added South Africa a year later in its only previous expansion.
The six new candidates will formally become members on Jan. 1, 2024, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said when he named the countries during a three-day leaders' summit he is hosting in Johannesburg.
The entry of oil powers Saudi Arabia and UAE highlights their drift away from the United States' orbit and ambition to become global heavyweights in their own right.
"BRICS has embarked on a new chapter in its effort to build a world that is fair, a world that is just, a world that is also inclusive and prosperous," Ramaphosa said.
"We have consensus on the first phase of this expansion process and other phases will follow."
The countries invited to join reflect individual BRICS members' desires to bring allies into the club.
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had vocally lobbied for neighbour Argentina's inclusion while Egypt has close commercial ties with Russia and India.
Russia and Iran have found common cause in their shared struggle against U.S.-led sanctions and diplomatic isolation, with their economic ties deepening in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

"BRICS is not competing with anyone," Russia's Vladimir Putin, who is attending the summit remotely due to an international warrant for alleged war crimes, said on Thursday.
"But it's also obvious that this process of the emerging of a new world order still has fierce opponents."
Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi celebrated his country's invitation to join BRICS with a swipe at Washington.
"The expansion of BRICS shows that the unilateral approach is on the way to decay," Iran's Arabic-language television network Al Alam quoted him as saying.
Beijing is close to Ethiopia and the country's inclusion also speaks to South Africa's desire to amplify Africa's voice in global affairs.
In a reflection of the bloc's growing influence, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres attended Thursday's expansion announcement and echoed BRICS' longstanding calls for reforms of the U.N. Security Council, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
"For multilateral institutions to remain truly universal, they must reform to reflect today's power and economic realities," he said.
Though home to about 40% of the world's population and a quarter of global gross domestic product, internal divisions have long hobbled BRICS ambitions of becoming a major player on the world stage.
BRICS countries have economies that are vastly different in scale and governments with often divergent foreign policy goals, a complicating factor for the bloc's consensus decision-making model.
The debate over enlargement has topped the summit in South Africa. And while all BRICS members publicly expressed support for growing the bloc, there were divisions among the leaders over how much and how quickly.
Last minute deliberations over entry criteria and which countries to invite to join extended late into Wednesday evening.
Bloc heavyweight China has long called for an expansion of BRICS as it seeks to challenge Western dominance, a strategy that is shared by Russia.
Other BRICS members support fostering the creation of a multipolar global order. But Brazil and India have both also been forging closer ties with the West.
Brazil's Lula on Tuesday rejected the idea the bloc should seek to rival the United States and Group of Seven wealthy economies.

Headline: Fukushima wastewater released into the ocean, China bans all Japanese seafood
Article Content:
TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Japan started releasing treated radioactive water from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean on Thursday, a polarising move that prompted China to announce an immediate blanket ban on all aquatic products from Japan.
China is "highly concerned about the risk of radioactive contamination brought by... Japan's food and agricultural products," the customs bureau said in a statement.
The Japanese government signed off on the plan two years ago and it was given a green light by the U.N. nuclear watchdog last month. The discharge is a key step in decommissioning the Fukushima Daiichi plant after it was destroyed by a tsunami in 2011.
Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) (9501.T) said the release began at 1:03 p.m. local time (0403 GMT) and it had not identified any abnormalities.
However, China reiterated its firm opposition to the plan and said the Japanese government had not proved that the water discharged would be safe.
"The Japanese side should not cause secondary harm to the local people and even the people of the world out of its own selfish interests," its foreign ministry said in a statement.
Tokyo has in turn criticised China for spreading "scientifically unfounded claims."
It maintains the water release is safe, noting that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also concluded that the impact it would have on people and the environment was "negligible."
Japan has requested that China immediately lift its import ban on aquatic products and seeks a discussion on the impact of the water release based on science, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters.
Japan exported about $600 million worth of aquatic products to China in 2022, making it the biggest market for Japanese exports, with Hong Kong second. Sales to China and Hong Kong accounted for 42% of all Japanese aquatic exports in 2022, according to government data.
China customs did not give details on the specific aquatic products impacted by the ban and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Fukushima Daiichi plant was destroyed in March 2011 after a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake generated powerful tsunami waves causing meltdowns in three reactors.
The first discharge totalling 7,800 cubic metres - the equivalent of about three Olympic swimming pools of water - will take place over about 17 days.
According to Tepco test results released on Thursday, that water contained about up to 63 becquerels of tritium per litre, below the World Health Organization drinking water limit of 10,000 becquerels per litre. A becquerel is a unit of radioactivity.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu  Acquire Licensing Rights
The IAEA also released a statement saying its independent on-site analysis had confirmed the tritium concentration was far below the limit.
"There are not going to be any health effects… There is no scientific reason to ban imports of Japanese food whatsoever," said Geraldine Thomas, former professor of molecular pathology at London's Imperial College.
But Japanese fishing groups, hit with years of reputational damage from radiation fears, still oppose the plan.
"All we want is to be able to continue fishing," the head of the Japan Fisheries Co-operative said in a statement that touched on the "mounting anxiety" of the community.
Separately from China, Hong Kong and Macau have announced their own ban starting Thursday, which covers Japanese seafood imports from 10 regions.
South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said import bans on Fukushima fisheries and food products will stay in place until public concerns were eased.
Japan will conduct monitoring around the water release area and publish results weekly starting on Sunday, Japan's environment minister said. The release is estimated to take about 30 years.
In Hong Kong, Jacay Shum, a 73-year-old activist, held up a picture portraying IAEA head Rafael Grossi as the devil.
"Japan's actions in discharging contaminated water are very irresponsible, illegal, and immoral," said Shum, who was among a group of about 100 marchers. "No one can prove that the nuclear waste and materials are safe. They are completely unsafe."
South Korean police arrested at least 16 protesters who entered the Japanese embassy in Seoul, although South Korea's government has said its own assessment found no problems with the scientific and technical aspects of the release.
North Korea's foreign ministry demanded that the water discharge be immediately halted, calling it a "crime against humanity", state media reported.
A few dozen protesters gathered in front of Tepco's headquarters in Tokyo holding signs reading "Don't throw contaminated water into the sea!"
"The Fukushima nuclear disaster is not over. This time only around 1% of the water will be released," 71-year-old Jun Iizuka, who attended the protest, told Reuters. "From now on, we will keep fighting for a long time to stop the long-term discharge of contaminated water."

KYIV, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Ukraine's navy and military intelligence carried out a "special operation" overnight in which units landed on Russian-occupied Crimea, the defence ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) said on Thursday.
The operation, which Reuters was unable to independently confirm, would amount to a rare demonstration that Ukrainian forces are able to stage ground operations in Crimea, which Russia seized and annexed in 2014.
Brief and dark video footage posted alongside the statement showed a small motorboat moving through water at night near a coastline. HUR said the landing point was on the western tip of Crimea, near the settlements of Olenivka and Mayak.
"Special units on watercraft landed on the shore in the area of the Olenivka and Mayak settlements," HUR said in a statement.
It said "all goals" had been achieved and casualties inflicted on the enemy, but did not identify the goals.
"Also, the state flag flew again in Ukrainian Crimea," it said, without saying where exactly or providing further details.
Russia did not comment on the report, which coincided with Ukraine's Independence Day.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed on Wednesday to end Russia's occupation of Crimea although Russia shows no sign of abandoning the peninsula.
On Wednesday, Ukraine's military intelligence also reported deliberately luring a Russian military pilot to land his Mi-8 helicopter at a Ukrainian airfield.

Headline: Analysis: Prigozhin's presumed death removes one problem, may create new ones for Putin
Article Content:

LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The presumed death of mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in a fiery plane crash leaves Russian President Vladimir Putin stronger in the short term, removing a powerful figure who had defied his authority and threatened to make him look weak.
But it also deprives him of a forceful and astute player who had proved his utility to the Kremlin by sending his fighters into some of the bloodiest battles of the Ukraine war and advancing Russian interests across Africa.
After 24 hours of silence, Putin paid "sincere condolences" to the families of all 10 people on the plane that crashed north of Moscow, and praised Prigozhin as a "talented businessman". It is not yet clear what caused the plane to drop from the sky.
He promised a full investigation, but its outcome is unlikely to shake a widespread belief that Prigozhin was killed as an act of vengeance for staging a mutiny in late June.
The United States is looking at a number of theories over what brought down the plane, including a surface-to-air missile hitting it, U.S. officials told Reuters.
Analysts said the assumption of Kremlin involvement may actually suit Putin's purpose.
"Whatever the reasons for the plane crash, everyone will see it as an act of retribution and reprisal, and the Kremlin will not particularly interfere with this," Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R.Politik consultancy, said.
"From the point of view of Putin, as well as many among the security forces and the military, Prigozhin's death should be a lesson to any potential followers."
The crash came two months to the day after Prigozhin and his Wagner mercenaries staged a mutiny in which they took control of a southern city and advanced towards Moscow, shooting down a number of Russian air force planes and killing their pilots.
Putin, who has spoken in the past of his hatred of traitors, described it at the time as a "stab in the back".
Since the mutiny, Prigozhin had halted a running feud with the defence establishment but otherwise continued his operations, appearing to move freely in and out of Russia despite a deal with the Kremlin under which he was meant to leave for Belarus.
Abbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter now designated a "foreign agent" by Russia, said Prigozhin had wrongly assumed he was indispensable to Putin because of the scale and importance of his activities.
These included extensive operations in Africa, where Wagner has expanded its mercenary services in countries such as Mali and the Central African Republic in exchange for gold- and diamond-mining concessions.
While portraying it as a purely private commercial operation, the Kremlin has used Wagner to expand Russian influence on the continent in competition with Western powers such as France and the United States.
Prigozhin "assumed that Putin would not want to risk all this", Gallyamov said. "(He) underestimated how important it was for Putin to send a signal to all potential rebels: guys, don't think you can do this and then remain alive."
But the death of Prigozhin, if confirmed, is not without cost to Putin.
Analysts said it opens up the prospect of a messy struggle for control of Wagner's huge business empire, and a possible split between pragmatists willing to integrate with the defence ministry and an aggrieved ultranationalist faction which is already venting its anger on social media channels.
"I think it's possible that in many ways it will become kind of a headless 'Game of Thrones' or 'Sopranos' type of environment where we have competing smaller factions and smaller splinters of Wagner," said Andrew Borene, executive director of threat intelligence firm Flashpoint and a former U.S. intelligence official.
"In the long-term I think it's a strategic loss (to Russia)," he said.
Samuel Ramani, an analyst at London's RUSI think-tank and author of the book "Russia in Africa" said the loss of Prigozhin's extensive network would be a downside for Putin.
"He loses many of the personal contacts that Prigozhin has managed to cultivate on that continent, including the kind of contacts that would be necessary to export gold and diamonds out of sanctioned countries such as Mali and the Central African Republic," Ramani said in a telephone interview.
The plane crash happened on the same day that Russian state media reported the removal of Sergei Surovikin, the former commander of Russia's war effort in Ukraine, as head of the Russian air force. Widespread but unconfirmed reports said Surovikin had been placed under investigation for possible complicity in Prigozhin's mutiny.
The downfall of both men - widely seen as two of Russia's most effective operators in a war where it has seen many embarrassing failures - could hamper Moscow's ability to mount sustainable offensive operations in the next year, Ramani said.
If Putin was responsible for Prigozhin's death, he said, it demonstrated he was willing to engage in brutal repression of any kind of dissent.
"But it also shows a vulnerability too because he needs to use force now to repress these ultranationalists who he previously was able to co-opt and pacify by including them in his coalition. And that doesn't speak well to Putin's sustainability beyond 2024."
Robert Horvath, a Russia specialist at La Trobe University in Melbourne, said Putin's position remained fragile.
"The problem with killing Prigozhin is that it risks provoking acts of revenge from the tens of thousands of Wagner mercenaries - some battle-hardened veterans, some convicted criminals - who have fought under the Wagner banner," he said.
"It also risks drawing fresh attention to Prigozhin's populist campaign, his condemnation of the regime's justification for the war, and of the vast gulf separating the frivolous children of the ruling elite from those of ordinary people, who were returning from Ukraine in coffins."

Headline: First Republican presidential debate highlights: Four takeaways

WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Eight contenders for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination jockeyed for voters’ attention on Wednesday at the party’s first debate, while the front-runner Donald Trump, the former president, bypassed the event.
Here are four takeaways from the debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin:
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stood at center stage, but he wasn’t at the center of the evening.
No candidate came into the debate facing more pressure than DeSantis. For weeks, his poll numbers have been sliding and the gap with Trump widening, jeopardizing his argument that he is voters' preferred alternative to Trump.
But for much of the night, DeSantis, 44, stood and watched as his rivals seized the spotlight.
His fellow candidates threw few attacks his way, something that came as a surprise. Whether that was a sign that they weren’t threatened by his flagging candidacy or that they had other priorities was unclear.
Before the debate, DeSantis' campaign told Reuters that all he needed to do was “hold serve" and stay steady - that he didn’t need a game-changing moment to reverse his downward momentum. The pressure was on the rest of the field to break out of single digits in national polls, an aide said.
It remains to be seen however whether DeSantis made a strong enough case to voters to boost his prospects in the weeks ahead.
In his first political debate, Vivek Ramaswamy, 38, was widely expected to be a wild card. He quickly learned that fire brings fire.
Ramaswamy, a businessman with no political experience who has been rising in some opinion polls, branded his rivals as "bought and paid for." He also referred to DeSantis as a “super PAC puppet," a dig at the deep-pocketed political action committee supporting his bid.
Mike Pence, 64, defending his four-year record as Trump’s vice president, tried to cut Ramaswamy down to size. "We don't need to bring in a rookie, we don't need to bring in people without experience," Pence said.
Pence’s problem? There seemed to be more supporters of the outsider Ramaswamy in the audience than for Pence, illustrating the difficulty his candidacy has had mustering traction. His critique brought forth a cascade of boos.
That didn’t stop Christie, 60, who tried to finish Ramaswamy off much as he famously took down Senator Marco Rubio during the 2016 presidential campaign.
"I've had enough, already tonight, of a guy who sounds like ChatGPT standing up here,” Christie said.
Nikki Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, assailed Ramaswamy's lack of foreign policy experience after he said he would not support the U.S. role in Ukraine.
“He wants to hand Ukraine to Russia, he wants to let China eat Taiwan, he wants to go and stop funding Israel,” Haley said. “You don’t do that to friends."
Trump skipped the debate for a pre-recorded interview with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, as the debate began.
His absence from the stage gave the debate the feel of an undercard in boxing, with the winner seeking a shot at the champ. Come Thursday, he is likely to wipe the debate from the news cycle when he turns himself in at a Georgia courthouse on racketeering charges stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Debate moderator Bret Baier of Fox News on Wednesday called Trump “the elephant not in the room.”
As the debate entered its second hour, the candidates on stage were asked about Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
By and large, they fell into predictable patterns. Pence defended certifying the electoral vote in the U.S. Congress despite pressure from Trump. Christie, Trump’s most persistent critic, said his conduct was beneath “the office of president.” DeSantis argued the party needed to focus on the future.
Trump had a fierce defender in Ramaswamy, who called him “the best president of the 21st century” and vowed to pardon him if he is convicted of federal crimes.
Haley spoke to the millions of Republicans watching at home.
"We have to look at the fact that three quarters of Americans don't want a rematch between Trump and Biden,” said Haley, 51. “And we have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America. We can't win a general election that way."
The debate found the candidates grappling with the best way to approach abortion as a political issue. While most on stage support restrictions in some form, the issue has proven to be a profound vulnerability for the party in recent general elections.
Haley, who said she was strongly anti-abortion, seemed to try to find a better way to speak to moderate voters on the topic.
“Can't we all agree that we're not going to put a woman in jail or give her the death penalty if she gets an abortion?” said Haley, the only woman on the debate stage. “Let's treat this like a respectful issue that it is and humanize the situation and stop demonizing that situation."
DeSantis was pressed on his support for Florida’s six-week abortion ban, which he signed into law in April, a move some wealthy supporters found too extreme.
Asked if he would support a six-week federal ban, DeSantis was evasive, suggesting it was an issue that would be best left to the states but also saying he would support “the cause of life.”
Pence accused Haley of being too soft on the issue.
“Consensus is the opposite of leadership,” he told her. “It’s not a states-only issue. It’s a moral issue.”
Haley countered by saying Pence wasn’t being honest with voters. She argued there would not be enough support in Congress for a federal ban.

Headline: Who is Vivek Ramaswamy, Republican presidential candidate?
Article Content:
Aug 23 (Reuters) - Vivek Ramaswamy, a multimillionaire former biotech executive, has a chance to build on the attention he has been getting in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination at Wednesday night's debate.
Here are some facts about Ramaswamy's life and career:
Ramaswamy, 38, was born in Ohio to immigrant parents from southern India. He was raised in the Hindu faith of his parents, but went to a Catholic high school. He earned a biology degree at Harvard University before moving on to Yale Law School.
Ramaswamy worked as a hedge fund investor and says he had already made several million dollars before graduating from Yale. In 2014 he founded his own biotech company, Roivant Sciences(ROIV.O), which bought patents from larger companies for drugs that had not yet been fully developed and marketed. He resigned as CEO in 2021. In 2023 the business magazine Forbes estimated Ramaswamy's wealth at $630 million.
Ramaswamy says he was a libertarian during college. While at Harvard, he would perform libertarian-themed rap songs under the stage name "Da Vek". He has reprised some of his rap skills on the campaign trail this year. His performance of Eminem's 'Lose Yourself' at the Iowa State Fair this month went viral on social media.

Ramaswamy says he voted for a libertarian in the 2004 presidential election, but did not vote in 2008, 2012 or 2016. He has contributed to both Republican and Democratic candidates. He says he voted for former Republican President Donald Trump in 2020.
In recent years Ramaswamy has become a fierce conservative. In his 2021 bestseller 'Woke, Inc.', Ramaswamy decries decisions by some big companies to base business strategy around social justice and climate change concerns, and lambastes "wokeism" as an insidious influence on hard work, capitalism, religious faith and patriotism. The book raised Ramaswamy's profile among conservatives, and he began his rapid ascension as a right-wing star.
Ramaswamy declared his campaign for president in February, at a time when his bid looked like a long shot. Ramaswamy still languishes in the single digits in most polls but has been gaining on many of his rivals, most notably Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is now fighting to retain his second-place status.
Ramaswamy has been a fierce defender of Trump while seeking to appeal to Christian evangelicals, an important part of the Republican primary electorate. Although a Hindu, Ramaswamy has been telling voters that the U.S. is based on "Christian values" and "Judeo-Christian values" and has described himself as an American nationalist.
His policy positions are mostly deeply conservative. He opposes affirmative action and supports state-level bans on abortion after six weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and if the mother's life is in danger. He wants to greatly expand the powers of the presidency and dismantle much of the federal government, including the FBI, the Department of Education and the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service.
He opposes NATO membership for Ukraine and has said Kiev should make concessions to Russia to end the war, including allowing it to retain parts of Ukraine it already occupies.

Headline: US House Republicans launch probe of Atlanta DA in Trump election case
Article Content:
Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks to the media after a Grand Jury brought back indictments against former president Donald Trump and 18 of his allies in their attempt to overturn the state's 2020 election results, in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. August 14, 2023. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights
WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday launched an investigation of Fani Willis, the district attorney in Georgia's Fulton County, as former President Donald Trump prepared to report to jail on criminal charges she brought involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump ally, sent Willis a letter raising questions about whether she coordinated her probe with the U.S. Justice Department, including Special Counsel Jack Smith, or used federal tax money in the investigation.
"The federal government has a substantial interest in the welfare of former presidents," Jordan wrote in a five-page letter to Willis.
"And because this former president is a current candidate for that office, the indictment implicates another core federal interest: a presidential election," Jordan said.
Jordan raised concerns about her motivation in bringing the case and asserted congressional authority to "probe whether former presidents are being subjected to politically motivated investigations and prosecutions." Jordan also indicated in the letter that lawmakers could consider legislation about the use of federal funds by state law enforcement in the future.
Willis's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House. Jordan and two other House Republican chairmen have pursed a similar probe of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought criminal charges against Trump involving hush money paid to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Bragg then sued Jordan to stop what the district attorney called a "campaign of intimidation."
Trump has faced criminal charges in four cases this year, two brought by Smith. Trump, the first former U.S. president ever to face charges, is the front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination to face President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the 2024 U.S. election.
Jordan gave Willis until 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) on Sept. 7 to turn over documents and communications involving any use of federal funds by her office and any contacts in the Trump case with officials at the Justice Department or elsewhere in the Biden administration.
The House investigation was disclosed three days after Trump accused Willis on his social media platform of "continuing to campaign, and raise money on, this WITCH HUNT. This is in strict coordination with Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ. It is all about ELECTION INTERFERENCE!"
The House Judiciary Committee released Jordan's letter as Trump prepared on Thursday to be fingerprinted and photographed at an Atlanta jail on 13 felony counts including racketeering, which is typically used to target organized crime.
In the case brought by Willis, Trump was accused of unlawfully pressuring Georgia state officials to reverse his 2020 election loss to Biden in the state.
House Republicans have sought to defend Trump in the four cases by alleging that the U.S. justice system has been "weaponized" against him by Biden.
Trump, 77, faces 91 separate criminal counts overall in the court cases. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Headline: Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin listed in Russian plane crash with no survivors
Article Content:
MOSCOW, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Russia's most powerful mercenary Yevgeny Prigozhin was on board a plane which crashed on Wednesday evening north of Moscow with no survivors, the Russian authorities said, two months to the day after he led an abortive mutiny against the army top brass.
There was no official comment from the Kremlin or the Defence Ministry on the fate of Prigozhin, head of the Wagner mercenary group and a self-declared enemy of the army's leadership over what he argued was its incompetent prosecution of Russia's war in Ukraine.
A Telegram channel linked to Wagner, Grey Zone, pronounced him dead, however, and hailed him as a hero and a patriot who it said had died at the hands of unidentified people it called "traitors to Russia."
A Reuters reporter at the crash site at first light on Thursday morning saw men stretchering black body bags. Part of the plane's tail and other fragments lay on the ground near a wooded area where forensic investigators had erected a tent. Mourners left flowers and lit candles near Wagner's offices in St Petersburg early on Thursday.
Amid fevered speculation and an absence of verifiable facts, some of his supporters have pointed the finger of blame at the Russian state, others at Ukraine which was due to mark its Independence Day on Thursday.
Whoever or whatever was behind the crash, his death would rid Putin of someone who had mounted the most serious challenge to the Russian leader's authority since he came to power in 1999.
Others who have opposed President Vladimir Putin or his interests have also died under unclear circumstances or come close to death, including outspoken political leaders and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied any state involvement in such incidents.
Prigozhin's death would also leave the Wagner Group, which incurred Putin's wrath in June by staging an abortive armed mutiny against the army's top brass, leaderless and raise questions about its future operations in Africa and elsewhere.
The Brazilian Embraer (EMBR3.SA) Legacy 600 model of executive jet that crashed has only recorded one accident in over 20 years of service, according to website International Aviation HQ, and it was not due to mechanical failure.
Embraer said it has complied with international sanctions imposed on Russia and had not provided maintenance for the aircraft since 2019.
The plane showed no sign of a problem until a precipitous drop in its final 30 seconds, according to flight-tracking data.
Rosaviatsia, Russia's aviation agency, published the names of all 10 people on board the downed plane, including Prigozhin and that of Dmitry Utkin, his right-hand man who helped found the mercenary group and bore the call sign "Wagner".
Russian investigators said they had opened a criminal investigation. Some unnamed sources told Russian media they believed the plane had been shot down by one or more surface-to-air missiles. Reuters could not confirm that.
The aircraft, which had been travelling from Moscow to St. Petersburg, crashed near the village of Kuzhenkino in the Tver Region, Russia's emergency situations ministry said.
Abbas Gallyamov, a former Putin speech writer turned critic whom the Russian authorities have branded a "foreign agent", suggested, without evidence, that the Russian leader, who is expected to run for another term in office next year, was behind the crash and had strengthened his authority in the process.

"The establishment is now convinced that it will not be possible to oppose Putin," Gallyamov wrote on Telegram. "Putin is strong enough and capable of revenge."
Bill Browder, a businessman with years of experience in Russia and another Kremlin critic, agreed.
"Putin never forgives and never forgets. He looked like a humiliated weakling with Prigozhin running around without a care in the world (after the mutiny). This will cement his authority," Browder wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
On a visit to California, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters he did not know what had happened.
"But I’m not surprised," Biden said. "There is not much that happens in Russia that Putin is not behind."
Flightradar24 online tracker showed that the Embraer plane (registration number RA-02795) carrying Prigozhin had dropped off the radar at 6:11 p.m. (1511 GMT). An unverified video clip posted to social media showed a plane resembling a private jet falling out of the sky.
Another unverified clip showed the burning wreckage of the plane on the ground. Rescuers had recovered all 10 bodies or what was left of them from the scene, Russian news agencies reported.
Soon after the plane crashed, a second private jet thought linked to Prigozhin which also appeared to be heading to St. Petersburg, Prigozhin's home base, turned back to Moscow, flight tracking data showed, and later landed.
Prigozhin, 62, spearheaded the mutiny against Russia's top army brass on June 23-24 which Putin said could have tipped Russia into civil war. Wagner fighters shot down Russian attack helicopters during the revolt, killing an unconfirmed number of pilots, infuriating the military.
He had also spent months criticising Russia's war in Ukraine, something Moscow calls a "special military operation", and had tried to topple Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff.
Many Russians had wondered how he was able to get away with such brazen criticism without consequence.
The mutiny was ended by an apparent Kremlin deal which saw Prigozhin agree to relocate to neighbouring Belarus. But in practice he had appeared to move freely inside Russia after the agreement which had reportedly guaranteed his personal safety.
Prigozhin posted a video address on Monday which he suggested was made in Africa. He turned up at a Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg in July.
Unconfirmed Russian media reports said that Prigozhin and his associates had attended a meeting on Wednesday with officials from the Russian Defence Ministry. Reuters could not confirm that.

Headline: Insight: China quietly recruits overseas chip talent as US tightens curbs

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE/WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - For a decade until 2018, China sought to recruit elite foreign-trained scientists under a lavishly funded program that Washington viewed as a threat to U.S. interests and technological supremacy.
Two years after it stopped promoting the Thousand Talents Plan (TTP) amid U.S. investigations of scientists, China quietly revived the initiative under a new name and format as part of a broader mission to accelerate its tech proficiency, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter and a Reuters review of over 500 government documents spanning 2019 to 2023.
The revamped recruitment drive, reported in detail by Reuters for the first time, offers perks including home-purchase subsidies and typical signing bonuses of 3 to 5 million yuan, or $420,000 to $700,000, the three people told Reuters.
China operates talent programs at various levels of government, targeting a mix of overseas Chinese and foreign experts. The primary replacement for TTP is a program called Qiming overseen by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, according to national and local policy documents, online recruitment advertisements and a person with direct knowledge of the matter who, as with others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue's sensitivity.
The race to attract tech talent comes as President Xi Jinping emphasises China's need to achieve self-reliance in semiconductors in the face of U.S. export curbs. Regulations adopted by the U.S. Commerce Department in October restrict U.S. citizens and permanent residents from supporting the development and production of advanced chips in China, among other measures.
Neither China's State Council Information Office nor the ministry responded to questions about Qiming. China has previously said its overseas recruitment through the TTP aimed to build an innovation-driven economy and promote talent mobility, while respecting intellectual property rights, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.
Qiming, or Enlightenment, recruits from scientific and technological fields that include "sensitive" or "classified" areas, such as semiconductors, two of the people said. Unlike its predecessor, it does not publicise awardees and is absent from central government websites, which the sources said reflected its sensitivity.
Some of the documents mention Qiming alongside Huoju, or Torch, a longstanding initiative of the Ministry of Science and Technology that focuses on creating clusters of tech companies. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Qiming also operates in tandem with recruitment initiatives run by local and provincial authorities and a government-backed hiring drive by Chinese chip companies, according to two of the people and another source familiar with the matter. Reuters could not independently establish the companies involved.
The U.S. has long accused China of stealing intellectual property and technology, a charge Beijing has dismissed as politically motivated.
"Foreign adversaries and strategic competitors understand that acquiring top U.S. and Western talent is often just as good as acquiring the technology itself," said Dean Boyd, a spokesperson for the U.S. government's National Counterintelligence and Security Center, when asked about Chinese talent recruitment schemes.
"When that recruitment creates inherent conflicts of interest or commitment, that can create risks to U.S. economic and national security."
Curtailing intellectual property leakage via talent flows is difficult, said Nick Marro, a China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, because such efforts "can run the risk of turning into ethnically-charged witch hunts".
China's chip industry has flourished in recent years but faces a shortage of about 200,000 people this year, including engineers and chip designers, according to a 2021 report published by the China Center for Information Industry Development, a government think tank, and the China Semiconductor Industry Association.
China's newer talent endeavours, which like the TTP focus on elite-level recruitment, favour applicants trained at top foreign institutions, three sources said.
"Most of the applicants selected for Qiming have studied at top U.S universities and have at least one Ph.D," said one of these people, adding that scientists trained at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard and Stanford universities were among those sought by China. The universities did not respond to requests for comment.
Reuters could not determine how many experts have been recruited under Qiming or associated programs, though thousands have applied, according to Reuters' review of government documents.
U.S. officials say that while talent poaching in the U.S. is not illegal, university researchers risk breaking the law if they fail to disclose affiliations with Chinese entities while receiving U.S. government funds to conduct research, illegally share proprietary information, or violate export controls.
Reuters found more than a dozen advertisements for Qiming applicants posted since 2022 on Chinese platform Zhihu (2390.HK) and LinkedIn by people who identified themselves as recruiters.
In a February LinkedIn post, Chen Biaohua, who listed his employer as Beijing Talent Linked Information Technology, asked candidates eligible for Qiming and Huoju to email him their resumes.
The post said Chen was seeking "young talents" under 40 with a doctorate from well-known universities and overseas experience. He was also seeking applicants who held senior roles at foreign academic institutions or large companies.
Headhunting firm Hangzhou Juqi Technology posted an ad in March on ResearchGate, a social network for academics, seeking people with doctorates from top universities and experience at Fortune 500 companies to help recruit 5,000 overseas researchers for Chinese enterprises.
The ad described this effort as serving Qiming and Huoju, with each researcher able to obtain as much as 15 million yuan, or about $2.1 million, in rewards. It said that anyone who recommends a candidate who is then selected for the talent programs would receive "diamonds, bags, cars, and houses".
Chen and LinkedIn declined to comment. Questions sent to Chen's employer, as well as to Zhihu, ResearchGate and Hangzhou Juqi Technology yielded no responses.
One foreign-trained semiconductor expert at the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) was identified on its website as a 2021 Qiming recipient. Ma Yuanxiao is an associate professor at BIT's School of Integrated Circuits and Electronics, who did his masters at Britain's University of Nottingham between 2013 and 2015 and his Ph.D at the University of Hong Kong until 2019.
Ma and BIT did not respond to requests for comment.
Across China, provincial and municipal governments are pouring resources into the recruitment drive, official documents show.
One initiative is the Kunpeng Plan, run by authorities in eastern Zhejiang province, whose 2019 launch was covered in state media. The Zhejiang Daily reported in June 2022 that the program aimed to attract 200 tech experts in five years, with 48 already recruited.
In the eastern city of Wenzhou, local authorities' investment in each Kunpeng professional can reach up to 200 million yuan, including an individual reward, start-up funding and housing, according to a 2022 talent policy report by the city government.
A report by the Wenzhou branch of the Communist Party's Organization Department, which oversees personnel decisions, said its total budget in 2022 increased 49% from a year earlier, mainly because it had assigned 85 million yuan to Kunpeng and similar programs.
One Kunpeng recipient is Dawei Di, a Cambridge-educated professor at Zhejiang University whose research focuses on semiconductor optoelectronic devices, the university's journal reported in 2021.
In Huzhou, also in Zhejiang, employers that recommend candidates to Qiming can receive incentive payments of up to 1.5 million yuan from the city or district governments if those people are accepted, according to a 2021 city directive.
None of the city, provincial or Communist Party authorities, nor Di or his university, responded to queries from Reuters.
Despite Xi's emphasis on advancing China's chip know-how, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said many Chinese semiconductor experts overseas were wary of returning because of China's political environment and weaker position in chip development relative to the West.
"They have no idea if the programs could change overnight or lose government support," one said.
Zhuji, a county-level city in Zhejiang, reported in October 2022 that it had over 200 applicants for talent programs, mainly Qiming, but only eight successful candidates from the previous year had returned to China. Zhuji government's general office did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
Two people familiar with the matter said some Chinese scientists, especially those with foreign citizenship or permanent residency, worried that joining China's government talent programs could mean forgoing international opportunities or becoming subject to U.S. investigations.
In some cases, these people said, those experts will be offered roles at Chinese chip companies' overseas operations.
"Safer to have one foot in China, one foot out," one said.

OSLO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Norway will donate U.S.-made F-16 combat aircraft to Ukraine, the Norwegian prime minister announced during a visit to Kyiv on Thursday, joining an effort led by the Netherlands and Denmark.
F-16s have been on Ukraine's wish list for a long time because of their destructive power and global availability. The fighter jet is equipped with a 20mm cannon and can carry bombs, rockets and missiles.
"We are planning to donate Norwegian F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, and will provide further details about the donation, numbers and time frame for delivery, in due course," Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said in a statement.
Stoere met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv earlier on Thursday and announced donations of anti-aircraft missiles and other equipment.
"The donation of these F-16 jets will significantly strengthen Ukraine's military capabilities," Norway's Defence Minister Bjoern Arild Gram said in the statement.
Many NATO allies have F-16s - originally designed in the 1970s - making it easier to find spare parts compared with the Russian planes currently used by Ukraine.
Last year, the Norwegian air force retired its fleet of 57 F-16s and later agreed to sell 32 of them to NATO ally Romania in what Stoere has said was a "fixed and settled" deal.
A further 12 aircraft are due to be sold to a private company providing training for the U.S. Air Force, although this deal has yet to receive final approval and some analysts have said these jets could be suitable for a donation to Ukraine.
Of the 13 remaining F-16s, the Norwegian defence ministry said last year many were too costly or hard to repair and might be placed in a museum, used for parts or sent for scrapping.
Norway has replaced its F-16s with the successor model F-35.

Headline: US Central states, Texas in danger of power shortages in heat wave
Article Content:

Aug 24 (Reuters) - Two U.S. electric grids may not have enough power to meet demand plus required reserves on Thursday as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape a brutal heat wave blanketing Texas and other U.S. Central states.
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the grid for more than 26 million customers, urged residents to voluntarily conserve power on Thursday as it expects a "reserve capacity shortage with no market solution available."
Power grids carry reserves to ensure the system remains reliable in case a large power plant or transmission line fails unexpectedly.
When a grid does not have enough resources to meet demand plus required reserves, operators can take emergency steps to reduce usage and increase supplies.
Those steps include imports from other regions, calls for energy conservation and - in a worst-case situation - controlled, rotating outages to avoid uncontrolled blackouts.
Texas residents have worried about extreme weather since a deadly storm in February 2021 left millions without power, water and heat for days as ERCOT struggled to prevent a grid collapse.
AccuWeather forecast temperatures in Houston, the biggest city in Texas, would reach 107 degrees Fahrenheit (41.7 degrees Celsius) on Thursday. That compares with a normal high of 94 F (34 C) for this time of year.
ERCOT forecast demand would reach 84,928 megawatts (MW) on Thursday, just shy of its 85,435 MW record set Aug. 10.
Even though demand was not expected to hit a record, ERCOT forecast reserves would fall short because some power plants may not be available on Thursday.
Unlike other U.S. grids, which can import thousands of megawatts from neighboring regions, ERCOT is heavily dependent on its own generation since its transmission system has few interconnections with neighboring systems.
Next-day prices at the ERCOT North Hub , which includes Dallas, soared to $925 per megawatt hour for Thursday from $255 for Wednesday. That compares with an average of $75 so far this year, $78 in 2022 and a five-year (2018-2022) average of $66.
The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which oversees the grid serving 45 million people in 15 states from Minnesota to Louisiana, also projected it might not have enough resources to meet forecast demand on Thursday.
"Due to the extreme heat creating near-record electricity demand and unplanned generation outages over the last 12 hours, MISO has declared (an energy emergency alert)," MISO spokesman Brandon Morris said in an email.
"While stressed, the power grid remains stable and declaring (the alert) allows MISO to access additional resources to maintain reliability," Morris said, noting the grid is working with utilities and neighboring grids to "have every available resource available throughout the day."
MISO projected it would have 125,907 MW of supplies available with 120,656 MW from internal resources and 5,251 MW of imports.
That would not be enough to meet the grid's forecast peak of 127,692 MW, which would top the system's all-time high of 127,100 MW in July 2011.

Headline: RBC plans thousands of job cuts after profit beat; TD misses on higher expenses
Article Content:
[1/2]A Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) logo is seen on Bay Street in the heart of the financial district in Toronto, January 22, 2015. REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights
Aug 24 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (RY.TO) warned of a softer economy ahead and plans to cut about 1,800 job to reduce costs after Canada's largest bank beat analysts' estimates for the third quarter on Thursday.
Chief Executive Officer Dave McKay forecast slowing growth and lower inflation due to the lagging impact of monetary policy, combined with a slowdown in China and elevated climate and geopolitical risks.
"We are seeing evidence of slowing labor markets as evidenced by slowing wage growth, lower job postings and an increase in Canadian unemployment. Consequently, our base case forecasts a softer economic outlook," he told analysts.
"The operating environment is changing at a faster pace than we've seen for over a decade."
McKay in May said the lender would slow hiring after it overshot by thousands of people. The bank said the number of full-time employees was down 1% from the prior quarter, and it expects to further reduce headcount by about 1% to 2%. The bank had 93,753 full-time employees as of July 31.
"The bank did a commendable job in managing expenses, with an improvement in its overall efficiency ratio," Barclays analyst John Aiken said, noting the lender's earnings beat.
The country's second-largest bank Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO), however, missed analysts' estimates for quarterly profit, which was hurt by higher expenses, rainy day funds to cover for unpaid loans and weakness in its U.S. business.
TD set aside C$766 million, a jump from C$351 million a year ago, while RBC set aside C$616 million for credit losses, up from C$340 million, as consumers struggle to make payments amid high costs of living.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates 10 times since March of last year to tackle sticky inflation, boosting profitability for banks' consumer businesses as they benefit from higher earnings from loans.
That helped boost earnings at RBC's retail business by 5%. At TD, however, income from its Canadian personal and commercial banking segment fell 1% and fell 9% at its U.S retail unit.
"The higher interest rate would put pressure on the consumer. But we're seeing so far they continue to be resilient... but we're continuously monitoring very closely," TD CFO Kelvin Tran said in an interview.
Net interest income- the difference between what banks make on loans and pay out on deposits - rose 6.7% to C$6.29 billion at RBC and 3.5% to C$7.29 billion at TD.
RBC reported adjusted earnings of C$2.84 per share, beating analysts' estimates of C$2.71 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
The results also benefited from a low tax rate due to the Canada Recovery Dividend implemented in the 2023 budget.
TD's adjusted earnings of C$1.99 per share fell below the estimate of C$2.04. The bank's earnings were also impacted by a C$306 million charge related to the termination of its First Horizon acquisition.
RBC and TD together account for half of the market share among the big six Canadian banks with a market capitalization of C$168 billion and C$151 billion respectively.
Their stocks have however underperformed, falling about 5% and 6% so far this year, compared to the broader index's (.GSPTSE) 2.55% gain.
RBC's shares were up 1.7% while those of TD were down nearly 2% on Thursday morning.

Headline: US FDA panel votes against use of Medtronic's blood pressure treatment device
Article Content:

Aug 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) independent experts on Wednesday narrowly voted against recommending the approval of Medtronic's (MDT.N) blood pressure treatment device, saying risks tied to using it do not outweigh the benefits.
The same panel on Tuesday voted in favor of rival ReCor's device for use in a surgery called renal denervation in patients whose high blood pressure cannot be controlled by drugs.
When asked if the benefits outweighed the risks of the device, six members each voted for and against it, while one abstained. The chairperson of the panel then had to break the tie to vote against the device.
Separately, while all panel members voted the device was safe to use, 6 of 13 voted against its effectiveness.
The panel's recommendations are not binding, but are usually followed by the FDA.
"We appreciate the robust conversation that occurred prior to the vote," Jason Weidman, senior vice president and president of the Coronary and Renal Denervation business, Medtronic, said in a statement, adding, the company will continue to collaborate with the FDA on bringing a new option.
Japan-based Otsuka Holdings' (4578.T) unit ReCor's device was shown to provide a benefit in lowering blood pressure in clinical trials. Medtronic's device helped to lower blood pressure at the doctor's clinic but not at home, which is considered a more accurate measure of blood pressure monitoring.
Medtronic and the FDA's staff reviewers said before the meeting that additional analyses of the data showed the difference could be due to factors such as use of more drugs by patients treated with a "sham" procedure.
The company was seeking the health regulator's nod for the device indicated for patients whose hypertension, or high blood pressure, cannot be controlled with drugs.
The surgery, which is allowed in Europe and other parts of the world, is not approved in the U.S., after initial studies of older devices used in the procedure failed key studies, and several companies dropped out of the race to develop them.

Headline: BRICS expansion faces eleventh hour hurdle as divisions persist
Article Content:
[1/6]President of Brazil Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, President of China Xi Jinping, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pose for a BRICS family photo during the 2023 BRICS Summit at the Sandton Convention Centre in  Acquire Licensing Rights Read more
JOHANNESBURG, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A deal to expand the BRICS group of leading developing countries appeared stuck in eleventh hour negotiations at a leaders summit on Wednesday, threatening to undermine the bloc's ambition to give the "Global South" more clout in world affairs.
Agreement to expand BRICS - currently Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - could allow dozens of interested nations to seek admission as Beijing and Moscow push to forge it into a viable counterweight to the West.
The debate over enlargement has topped the agenda at the three-day summit taking place in Johannesburg. And while all BRICS members have publicly expressed support for growing the bloc, there were divisions among the leaders over how much and how quickly.
Summit host South Africa's foreign minister Naledi Pandor speaking on Wednesday said BRICS leaders had agreed on mechanisms for considering new members.
"We have agreed on the matter of expansion," she told a radio station run by her ministry.
"We have a document that we've adopted which sets out guidelines and principles, processes for considering countries that wish to become members of BRICS...That's very positive."
However, a BRICS member country official with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters that the leaders had not yet signed a finalised admission framework.
An agreement had been meant to be adopted following a plenary session earlier on Wednesday, but the source said it had been delayed after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced new admission criteria.
Asked about the delay, an Indian official aware of the details of the talks told Reuters late on Wednesday that the discussion were continuing.
"Yesterday ... India pushed for consensus on criteria as well as the issue of (candidate) names. There was a broad understanding," he said.
BRICS countries have economies vastly different in scale and governments with often divergent foreign policy goals, a complicating factor for a bloc whose consensus decision-making model gives each member a de facto veto.
Bloc heavyweight China has long called for an expansion of BRICS as a means of fostering a multipolar world order to challenge Western dominance.
"The world ... has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation," China's President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday. "We, the BRICS countries, should always bear in mind our founding purpose of strengthening ourselves through unity."
Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who is wanted under an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine and is attending the summit remotely, is keen to show Western powers he still has friends.
Brazil and India, in contrast, have both been forging closer ties with the West.
Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Tuesday rejected the idea the bloc should seek to rival the U.S. and Group of Seven wealthy economies.
The BRICS country official said that admission criteria India's Modi proposed included requiring members not be the target of international sanctions, ruling out potential candidates Iran and Venezuela.
Modi was also pushing for a minimum per capital GDP requirement.
"These are the things Modi brought in today," the official said. "So they are becoming a little bit of a spoiler."
More than 40 countries have expressed interest in joining BRICS, say South African officials, and 22 have formally asked to be admitted.
They represent a disparate pool of potential candidates - from Iran to Argentina - motivated largely by a desire to level a global playing field many consider rigged against them and attracted by BRICS' promise to rebalance the global order.
A number of prospective candidates are sending delegations to Johannesburg for meetings on Thursday - the last day of the summit - with the bloc's leaders.
Though home to about 40% of the world's population and a quarter of global GDP, BRICS members' failure to settle on a coherent vision for the bloc has long left it punching below its weight as a global political and economic player.
White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday that, due to the BRICS countries' divergence of views on critical issues, he did not see the bloc turning into a geopolitical rival of the United States.
But moves to expand the bloc and push its New Development Bank as an alternative to established multilateral lenders are raising concern among some in the West.
Werner Hoyer, the head of European Investment Bank, warned Western governments on Wednesday that they were in danger of losing the confidence of the "Global South", unless they urgently intensified their own support efforts for poorer countries.
