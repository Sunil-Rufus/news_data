Headline: Biden resists pressure from lawmakers and seeks short extension to key China science pact
Article Content:
HONG KONG — The Biden administration is seeking a short-term extension to a landmark science and technology agreement with China despite pressure from some U.S. lawmakers who say Beijing could exploit it to gain a security and military advantage.
A six-month extension to the Science and Technology Agreement (STA) will keep the pact in force as the U.S. seeks “authority to undertake negotiations to amend and strengthen the terms,” a State Department spokesperson told NBC News on Wednesday.
Signed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, the STA was the first accord between the two countries after they normalized diplomatic relations.  It has historically been renewed roughly every five years and was due to lapse this weekend.
A lapse in the pact would not only imperil government-to-government collaboration in vital areas such as climate change and public health, it would also inhibit academic cooperation between the world’s two leading economies, supporters have warned.
The STA serves as the umbrella agreement for the science and technology relationship between the U.S. and Chinese governments, said Deborah Seligsohn, an assistant political science professor at Villanova University.
The STA serves as the umbrella agreement for the science and technology relationship between the U.S. and Chinese governments, said Deborah Seligsohn, an assistant political science professor at Villanova University.
“If it were to go away, not only would it impede government-to-government cooperation, but it would also put other science cooperation at risk,” said Seligsohn, a former environment, science, technology and health counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
China also considers it the enabling document for all other science cooperation with the U.S., including with academic and research institutions.
But the agreement’s renewal faced resistance from lawmakers who argue that collaboration on technologies in sensitive fields could advance China’s military modernization. In June, 10 Republican members of Congress sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging him not to renew.
“We are clear-eyed to the challenges posed by the PRC’s national strategies on science and technology, Beijing’s actions in this space, and the threat they pose to U.S. national security and intellectual property and are dedicated to protecting the interests of the American people,” the State Department spokesperson said.
Evidence suggests that China “will continue to look for opportunities to exploit partnerships organized under the STA to advance its military objectives to the greatest extent possible and, in some cases, to attempt to undermine American sovereignty,” they wrote in the letter, whose signatories included Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the chair of the House Republican Conference, and Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the chair of the House select committee on China.
“The United States must stop fueling its own destruction. Letting the STA expire is a good first step,” they added.
In a separate letter to Blinken last week, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also objected to the agreement’s renewal, citing the Chinese government’s human rights violations, lack of transparency during the Covid-19 pandemic and “disregard for intellectual property rights.”
“Cooperation with a nation so contrary to American values is untenable,” he wrote.
The Biden administration's plans aren't unprecedented. Under former President Donald Trump, the U.S. sought a similar short-term extension to renegotiate the terms of an annex of the agreement to strengthen intellectual property protections.
The State Department spokesperson said it was aware of the issues involved with working with China in the are of science and technology.
“We are clear-eyed to the challenges posed by the PRC's national strategies on science and technology, Beijing’s actions in this space, and the threat they pose to U.S. national security and intellectual property and are dedicated to protecting the interests of the American people,” they said, referring to the People’s Republic of China by its acronym.

Headline: India makes historic uncrewed landing on the moon's south pole
Article Content:
India made history Wednesday by becoming the first country to reach the lunar south pole.
An uncrewed robotic moon lander, operated by India’s space agency and known as the Chandrayaan-3, touched down on the moon’s south polar region shortly after 8:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.
The Indian Space Research Organization’s successful touchdown comes just days after a Russian spacecraft that was en route to the same area failed during an orbital maneuver and crashed into the lunar surface. The failure was a major setback for Russia’s space agency, known as Roscosmos.
The Chandrayaan-3 landing, however, is a huge boon for the world's most populous nation, which has been vying for greater influence in the cosmos, through both the government’s space agency and private investment. Only three other countries in history have pulled off controlled, or “soft,” lunar landings: the United States, China and the former Soviet Union.
The moon’s south pole has long been of interest to space agencies and scientists because the region’s shadowed craters are thought to hold greater concentrations of water ice than elsewhere on the lunar surface, so it could be of critical importance for establishing long-term human settlements on the moon.
NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon, intends to land its Artemis III mission in the south polar region in 2025.
NASA Administrator Bill Nelson celebrated the landing in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
“And congratulations to #India on being the 4th country to successfully soft-land a spacecraft on the Moon,” he wrote. “We’re glad to be your partner on this mission!”
India and Russia had been locked in a race to the lunar south pole. The Luna-25 spacecraft that crashed was the first moon-landing spacecraft launched by Russia’s space agency in almost five decades. Roscosmos officials said Sunday they lost contact with the lander after it fired its engines in preparation for a descent to the surface.
The Chandrayaan-3 mission is designed to conduct a series of science experiments on the surface, including tests of mineral composition and seismic activity. The lander, which is roughly the size of an SUV, is also carrying a smaller rover. Both solar-powered craft are designed to operate for about two weeks on the moon.
The Chandrayaan-3, which launched into space July 14, was India’s second attempt to land at the moon’s south pole. A previous attempt in 2019 deployed a lunar orbiter, but the Chandrayaan-2 lander and rover crashed into the lunar surface.

Headline: Top Russian general 'fired' after vanishing in wake of Wagner mutiny
Article Content:
A top Russian general who has been missing from public view since the Wagner mercenary rebellion has now been dismissed as head of the country’s aerospace forces, Russian state media reported Wednesday.
It follows months of speculation about the fate of Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who had been the deputy commander of Russia’s forces in Ukraine but was known to have been close to mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin.
“The ex-Commander-in-Chief of the Aerospace Forces of Russia Sergei Surovikin has now been relieved of his post, Colonel General Viktor Afzalov, Chief of the General Staff of the Aerospace Forces, is temporarily acting as Commander-in-Chief of the Aerospace Forces,” Russian state news agency RIA reported, citing a single unnamed source.
Russian news outlet RBK and Rybar, a popular Telegram channel close to the country’s defense ministry, reported on Tuesday that Surovikin had been removed from his position. RBK reported, citing unnamed sources “familiar with personnel changes in the defense ministry,” that Surovikin was relieved of his duties due to a “transfer to another job,” and is currently “on a short leave.
The Izvestia newspaper, known for its pro-Kremlin view reported what it said was Surovikin resignation from the post, citing its own unnamed sources.
Alexei Venediktov, former head of the Ekho Moskvy, a prominent independent radio station that was shut down by authorities within days of the Ukraine invasion was the first to report that Surovikin had been dismissed on Tuesday, but said the general was being “retained by the defense ministry.”
NBC News could not confirm the reports.
There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin or Russian defense ministry.
Surovikin has not been heard from publicly since Prigozhin’s short-lived mutiny against Russia’s military leadership earlier this summer.
No official charges have been filed against Prigozhin and he appears to have been moving around the country freely. But this does not seem to have not been the case for Surovikin.
The general has not been seen in public since he appeared in a video urging Prigozhin to stand down in the early hours of the mutiny.
Days after the rebellion, speculation swirled in Russian and foreign media that he had been detained on suspicion of aiding the rebels. Despite months of vitriol directed at Russia’s defense ministry, Prigozhin had on numerous occasions praised Surovikin as one of the only effective generals in the Russian army, and the two are considered close.
Reuters and the New York Times both cited U.S. officials in the days after the mutiny saying that Surovikin was sympathetic to Prigozhin’s rebellion and may have even had “advance knowledge” of the mercenary chief’s plans. The reports were dismissed as “speculation and gossip” by the Kremlin at the time.
The rumors about Surovikin’s arrest or any role in Prigozhin’s rebellion remained unconfirmed by Russia’s defense ministry or the Kremlin since then. His exact whereabouts remain unknown.
Surovikin, 56, had earned the nickname “Gen. Armageddon” for his brutal tactics in the war in Syria, in which Russia has played a key part propping the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Surovikin was awarded the “Hero of Russia” title for his “courage and heroism” in Syria, according to the defense ministry profile of the general.
He has commanded Russia’s Aerospace Forces since late 2017. Before that, he was the commander of Russia’s Eastern Military District, according to the ministry.
Surovikin is widely considered one of the most effective and battle-hardened Russian generals.
Last October, he was appointed as the overall commander of Russia’s forces in Ukraine amid growing criticism of Russia’s battlefield failures.
He oversaw the aerial bombardment of Ukraine’s power grid infrastructure last fall, but was forced to withdraw from the key strategic city of Kherson just a month after his appointment. While many saw it as a defeat, some Kremlin hawks praised him for avoiding unnecessary personnel and equipment losses amid the inevitable liberation of the city by Ukrainian forces.
Surovikin was replaced in this post by Gen. Valery Gerasimov in January, and was made one of Gerasimov’s deputies.
Afzalov was previously deputy to Surovikin and has been chief of staff of the Aerospace Forces for at least four years, according to British military intelligence.
During Surovikin’s absence from public view, Afzalov was shown on television briefing Gerasimov last month.
