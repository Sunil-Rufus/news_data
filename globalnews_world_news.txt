In a move aimed at growing the bloc’s clout, leaders of the BRICS group of developing nations have decided to invite six new countries to become members of the group, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday.
“We have decided to invite the Argentine Republic, the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to become full members of BRICS,” he said.
“The membership will take effect from the 1st of January 2024.”
Expansion could also pave the way for dozens of interested countries to seek admission to BRICS, which is currently made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin told the BRICS summit that Moscow intends to deepen ties with African countries, and that it would remain a reliable partner for food and fuel supplies.
The debate over enlargement has topped the agenda at the three-day summit taking place in Johannesburg.
And while all BRICS members publicly expressed support for growing the bloc, there were divisions among the leaders over how much and how quickly.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the bloc’s expansion should be an example to other global institutions founded in the 20th century that have become outdated.

Headline: Russia extends pre-trial detention of U.S. journalist by 3 months

U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich had his pre-trial detention extended by three months by a Russian court on Thursday, Interfax reported, on charges of espionage that he denies.
The Moscow court extended the detention of the Wall Street Journal reporter to Nov. 30 from Aug. 30. Gershkovich was present at the hearing.
Gershkovich was arrested on March 29 in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on spying charges that carry up to 20 years in prison.
His newspaper has emphatically rejected the charge and the United States has accused Russia of conducting “hostage diplomacy,” at a time when bilateral relations are at their lowest point for more than 60 years due to Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.
The FSB security service said Gershkovich was collecting information about a Russian defense company that was a state secret. The Kremlin said he was caught “red-handed” but has provided no detail to support the assertion.
The White House has called the charges “ridiculous” and President Joe Biden has said Gershkovich’s detention is “totally illegal.”
No date has been set for a trial. Gershkovich has so far failed in two appeals, in April and June, against his pre-trial detention in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, where suspects accused by the KGB security service were held in Soviet times.
U.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy has been allowed to visit him in prison only three times, most recently on Aug. 14, in the nearly five months since he was arrested.
Russia has said that any prisoner exchange could only be considered after a court verdict, and via a special channel handled by the security services.
It has agreed to high-profile swaps in the past, most recently in December 2022 when it traded Brittney Griner, a U.S. basketball star convicted of a drugs offense in Russia for Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout.
Washington has pledged to do “whatever it takes” to bring home Gershkovich and ex-Marine Paul Whelan, convicted of espionage in 2020 and serving 16 years in a Russian penal colony on spying charges that he too denies.
The United States has designated both men as “wrongfully detained,” meaning that it considers the charges against them to be bogus and politically motivated.

Ukraine’s navy and military intelligence carried out a “special operation” overnight in which units landed on Russian-occupied Crimea, the defense ministry’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) said on Thursday.
The operation, which Reuters was unable to independently confirm, would amount to a rare demonstration that Ukrainian forces are able to stage ground operations in Crimea, which Russia seized and annexed in 2014.
Brief and dark video footage posted alongside the statement showed a small motorboat moving through water at night near a coastline. HUR said the landing point was on the western tip of Crimea, near the settlements of Olenivka and Mayak.
“Special units on watercraft landed on the shore in the area of the Olenivka and Mayak settlements,” HUR said in a statement.
It said “all goals” had been achieved and casualties inflicted on the enemy, but did not identify the goals.
“Also, the state flag flew again in Ukrainian Crimea,” it said, without saying where exactly or providing further details.
Russia did not comment on the report, which coincided with Ukraine’s Independence Day.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed on Wednesday to end Russia’s occupation of Crimea although Russia shows no sign of abandoning the peninsula.
On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military intelligence also reported deliberately luring a Russian military pilot to land his Mi-8 helicopter at a Ukrainian airfield.

Headline: Japan’s release of treated nuclear wastewater sparks fears among neighbours
Article Content:

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.
Seoul office worker Kim Mijeong said she intends to stop eating seafood because she deeply mistrusts the safety of Japan’s release of treated radioactive wastewater into the sea from its crippled nuclear power plant.
“We should absolutely cut back on our consumption of seafood. Actually, we can’t eat it,” Kim said. “I can’t accept the Japanese plan because it’s too unilateral and is proceeding without countermeasures.”
Many foreign experts said the water discharge will have a negligible impact on the environment and human health. The International Atomic Energy Agency also said it has experts on the ground to ensure the release goes as planned. But with the discharge starting Thursday, public fears and frustration were being shared in its Asian neighbors, where many still bear strong resentment over Japan’s World War II aggression.
In response to the release, China banned seafood from Japan. Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Shu Jueting called the discharge “extremely selfish and irresponsible” and said it would “cause damage and harm to the global marine environment that cannot be predicted.”
Hong Kong and Macau said they were banning seafood from Fukushima and nine other Japanese prefectures. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry called the release a “crime against humanity” and said Japan would be wholly responsible its “catastrophic consequences.”
South Korean police detained 16 student activists Thursday for allegedly trying to enter the Japanese Embassy illegally to protest the release. The activists entered the building housing the embassy, shouted slogans and unfolded banners but failed to enter embassy offices, according to police.
In South Korea, fierce domestic political wrangling has erupted over its own government’s endorsement of the Japanese plan. Liberal critics accused the conservative government led by President Yoon Suk Yeol of pushing to improve ties with Japan at the sacrifice of public health.
“The Yoon Suk Yeol government and the ruling People Power Party are accomplices in the dumping of the wastewater,” said Kwon Chil-seung, a spokesperson for the main opposition Democratic Party.
The governing party accused the opposition of inciting anti-Japan sentiment and public fears for political gain, undermining South Korea’s national interests and driving those in the domestic fisheries and seafood industries to the edge.
Yoon’s government and the Democratic Party have already fought bitterly over another Japan issue – Yoon’s contentious decision to take a major step toward easing historical grievances over forced Korean laborers during the Japanese colonial period. The Democratic Party accused Yoon of making concessions to Japan without receiving steps in return. Yoon maintains that improved ties with Japan are necessary because of shared challenges like North Korea’s advancing nuclear arsenal and the intensifying U.S.-China rivalry.
Yoon administration officials have tried to ease public concerns by expanding radiation tests on seafood at major fish markets. Last month, some governing party lawmakers even drank seawater from fish tanks at a seafood market in Seoul to emphasize food safety.
But surveys of South Koreans show that more than 80 per cent of respondents oppose the Japanese discharge plan and more than 60 per cent said they won’t eat seafood after the water release begins.
“I totally oppose the Japanese plan. The radioactive wastewater is truly a bad thing,” said Lee Jae-kyung, a Seoul resident. “My feelings toward Japan have worsened because of the wastewater release.”
Fears about the wastewater are taking a heavy toll on some businesses in South Korea’s seafood industry.
In a seafood market in the southeastern port city of Busan, fishmonger Kim Hae-cheol said his revenues have halved since a few months ago and worried that his business would suffer more after the start of the discharge.
“I haven’t had any customers today. In past years, I sold fish worth 400,000-500,000 won ($300-$380) by this time on a normal day,” Kim said in a midday phone interview Wednesday. “Others in this market have had few customers today as well.”
Kim said he trusts the safety reviews by the IAEA, Japanese and South Korean officials, but that his business has been battered mainly because some opposition politicians and media outlets “make much ado.”
Japan also faced strong protests from local fishing organizations, which worry their catches will be shunned. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has promised his government’s full support for fishing communities during the decades the wastewater will be released. The National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives opposes the release, but its leaders say some members have gained confidence in the plan’s safety.
Hong Seong-been, a Seoul resident, said political strife over the release has left many with a lack of genuine information about whether the water is truly safe or not.
In Hong Kong, about a dozen residents took part in a march in a central business district to protest against Japan’s move.
After the protesters reached the building housing the Japanese Consulate, they tore up a big banner bearing Japan’s flag and the words “No trace of humanity. An enemy of the whole world.” Some held up placards calling for Kishida to step down.
The discharge plans have dealt a blow to Japanese restaurants which were already reeling from other problems, said Martin Chan, a director of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades. If Hong Kong follows China’s lead and bans all seafood from Japan, he will have to suspend operations at his Japanese restaurant, he said.
During lunch hour, some residents rushed to Japanese restaurants and supermarkets to have what they called their last “safe” sushi meals.
Housewife Vivian Li said she would stop eating aquatic products from Japan after finishing her sushi lunch. Li said she likes eating Japanese food but she had to make the decision due to health concerns.
“I want to act as a role model for my children, so they will stop eating these products even when they grow up,” she said.
But young professional Janet Yip said she would not cut her consumption of Japanese food because the release plans meet international standards.
In Taiwan, reactions to the release plan were muted. On a governmental level, Taipei is aligned with Tokyo on a score of issues and hasn’t vocally opposed the discharge plan, which has been portrayed by Taiwanese media as conforming to international norms.
Taiwan’s Atomic Energy Council, a government agency, expressed concern in the past over the discharge. On Tuesday, it said it would closely monitor radiation levels in waters around Taiwan.
The Philippines, which receives coast guard vessels and other aid from Japan, also stressed that it was looking at the issue from a scientific perspective and recognized the IAEA’s expertise.
“As a coastal and archipelagic state, the Philippines attaches utmost priority to the protection and preservation of the marine environment,” the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
Associated Press journalists Jin-man Lee in Seoul, Simina Mistreanu in Taipei, Taiwan, Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, and Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.

Headline: India becomes 1st country to land spacecraft near moon’s south pole

India became the first country to land a spacecraft near the moon’s south pole on Wednesday — a historic voyage to uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold vital reserves of frozen water, and a technological triumph for the world’s most populous nation.
After a failed attempt to land on the moon in 2019, India now joins the United States, the Soviet Union and China as only the fourth country to achieve this milestone. A lander with a rover inside touched down on the lunar surface at 6:04 p.m. local time, sparking celebrations across India, including in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, where space scientists watching the landing erupted in cheers and applause.
The successful mission showcases India’s rising standing as a technology and space powerhouse and dovetails with the image that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to project: an ascendant country asserting its place among the global elite.
“India is now on the moon. India has reached the south pole of the moon — no other country has achieved that. We are witnessing history,” Modi said as he waved the Indian tri-colored flag while watching the landing from South Africa, where he is participating in the BRICS nations summit.
The lunar rover will slide down a flap from the lander within hours or a day and conduct experiments, including an analysis of the mineral composition of the lunar surface, said S. Somnath, chairman of the state-run Indian Space Research Organization.
The mission, which began more than a month ago at an estimated cost of $75 million, is expected to last another two weeks. Somnath said that India would next attempt a manned lunar mission.
Nuclear-armed India grew to become the world’s fifth-largest economy last year, and the success of the lunar mission will likely help Modi’s popularity ahead of a crucial general election next year.
India’s success comes just days after Russia’s Luna-25, which was aiming for the same lunar region, spun into an uncontrolled orbit and crashed. It would have been the first successful Russian lunar landing after a gap of 47 years. Russia’s head of the state-controlled space corporation Roscosmos attributed the failure to the lack of expertise due to the long break in lunar research that followed the last Soviet mission to the moon in 1976.
Modi’s efforts to revitalize India’s global standing — and to finally shake off the legacy of British colonialization — has resonated with many Indians. The moon landing was seen by many as further proof that their country is a rising, modern superpower.
Excited and anxious people across India crowded around televisions in offices, shops, restaurants and homes. Thousands prayed Tuesday for the success of the mission with oil lamps on the river banks, temples and religious places, including the holy city of Varanasi in northern India.
As the lander approached the lunar surface, dozens of people in a government-run planetarium started praying with folded hands. They switched to cheering and clapping once the lander touched down.
A man waved a banner reading ”The Moon in India’s arms.”
Shrini Singh, a New Delhi resident, said she got goosebumps. ”It’s a very happy moment, you can see the energy. It’s beyond words.”
Mitakshi Sinha, a student, said the successful mission motivated her. “And now I also want to be part of ISRO,” she said, referring to the country’s space agency.
India will host next month’s G-20 Summit, and Modi is expected to use the event to spotlight the country’s growing geopolitical clout. Even as it maintains historic ties with Russia, the U.S. and other Western nations continue to woo India, whom they see as a critical bulwark against China’s growing influence.
Accolades poured in from around the world to acknowledge India’s emergence as a modern space power.
NASA Administrator Bill Nelson congratulated India on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying “We’re glad to be your partner on this mission!”
“Incredible!” European Space Agency’s director general Josef Aschbacher tweeted.
India’s Chandrayaan-3 — “moon craft” in Sanskrit — took off from a launchpad in Sriharikota in southern India on July 14.
Many countries and private companies are interested in the south pole region because permanently shadowed craters may hold frozen water that could help future astronaut missions use it as a potential source of drinking water or to make rocket fuel.
The six-wheeled lander and rover module of Chandrayaan-3 is configured with payloads that will provide data to the scientific community on the properties of lunar soil and rocks, including chemical and elemental compositions.
India’s previous attempt to land a robotic spacecraft near the moon’s little-explored south pole ended in failure in 2019. It entered the lunar orbit but lost touch with its lander, which crashed while making its final descent to deploy a rover to search for signs of water. According to a failure analysis report submitted to the ISRO, the crash was caused by a software glitch.
The $140-million mission in 2019 was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits and were confirmed by India’s Chandrayaan-1 orbiter mission in 2008.
But India’s space program has been steadily advancing for years.
Active since the 1960s, India has launched satellites for itself and other countries, and successfully put one in orbit around Mars in 2014. India is planning its first mission to the International Space Station next year, in collaboration with the United States.
The anticipation for a successful landing rose after Russia’s failed attempt and as India’s regional rival China, which landed on the moon in 2013, reaches for new milestones in space. In May, China launched a three-person crew for its orbiting space station and hopes to put astronauts on the moon before the end of the decade. Relations between India and China have plunged since deadly border clashes in 2020.
Numerous countries and private companies are racing to successfully land a spacecraft on the lunar surface. In April, a Japanese company’s spacecraft apparently crashed while attempting to land on the moon. An Israeli nonprofit tried to achieve a similar feat in 2019, but its spacecraft was destroyed on impact.
Japan plans to launch a lunar lander to the moon over the weekend as part of an X-ray telescope mission, and two U.S. companies also are vying to put landers on the moon by the end of the year, one of them at the south pole. In the coming years, NASA plans to land astronauts at the lunar south pole, taking advantage of the frozen water in craters.
Pallava Bagla, a science writer and co-author of books on India’s space exploration, said the Russian failure days earlier did not put India off. He also said lessons learned from India’s failed mission four years ago were incorporated and a flawless mission was executed on Wednesday.
“Indians didn’t get derailed. They continued the journey with strength and confidence that paid off,” he said.

Headline: Wagner Group chief Prigozhin reportedly onboard deadly plane crash
Article Content:

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.
Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary Wagner Group who led an aborted revolt against President Vladimir Putin earlier this summer, was listed as a passenger on a private jet that crashed north of Moscow on Wednesday, according to Russia’s aviation agency.
The Federal Air Transport Agency, also known as Rosaviatsiya, published a list of seven passengers and three crew members aboard the plane provided by the aircraft’s owner on its Telegram channel. The list included Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin, a top Wagner commander believed to be the original founder of the private military group.
All of the people onboard are believed to have been killed in the crash, according to reports from Reuters, BBC and the Associated Press.
Reuters and The Associated Press quoted a Russian TASS news agency report, which cited Rosaviatsia, Russia’s aviation authority. The BBC cited the Russian aviation authority directly.
“An investigation has been launched into the Embraer plane crash that occurred tonight in the Tver region. According to the passenger list, among them is the name and surname of Yevgeny Prigozhin,” Rosaviatsiya said, according to those reports.
Earlier TASS had reported that 10 people had died after a private jet crashed in Russia’s Tver region north of Moscow while enroute to St. Petersburg from the Russian capital.
Unconfirmed media reports said the jet belonged to Prigozhin, AP reported. It’s not clear at this point whether Prigozhin was actually aboard the plane.
Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly told reporters in Charlottetown, P.E.I., Wednesday the government was aware of the reports.
“I’ll be able to have access to more information soon. I’ll be able to assess the impact, and there will be definitely important diplomatic conversations particularly with our allies in the G7 in the coming days,” she said.
William Pomeranz, head of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center, a think tank, said he didn’t think the Wagner Group could survive without Prigozhin – if he is dead.
“It’s unclear whether Russia will continue to pursue these types of adventures abroad,” Pomeranz said, speaking from Washington.
“I do not think that the Wagner Group survives the loss of Prigozhin unless there is someone who can step up in his shoes and continue Prigozhin’s mercenary appeal around the world.”
On June 23, Prigozhin led a brief mutiny in which Wagner fighters took control of the southern city of Rostov-on-Donand. His forces were said to be near Moscow when his revolt was defused in a deal brokered by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.
Prigozhin’s forces were key in Russia’s war in Ukraine, but the mercenary leader had made increasingly public criticisms of Moscow’s approach to the invasion. He had initially framed the revolt over an alleged attack on his troops carried out by the Russian military.
Prigozhin has said the mutiny was not aimed at overthrowing the Russian government but as “bringing to justice” the Russian military leaders for what he called their blunders and unprofessional actions in Ukraine.
Putin, who likened the events to the turmoil which engulfed Russia in the run-up to the 1917 Russian Revolution, wanted to “wipe out” Prigozhin during the mutiny, Lukashenko said at the time, and claimed he was persuaded not to by his Belarusian ally.
Lukashenko, both an old acquaintance of Prigozhin and close ally of Putin, said that he had advised the Russian president to think “beyond our own noses” and that Prigozhin’s elimination could lead to a widespread revolt by his fighters.
“I think that everyone realized, in the aftermath of the mutiny, that Prigozhin was living on borrowed time,” Pomeranz said, referring to past suspicious deaths of several prominent Russians shortly after they criticized Putin.
The deaths have not been linked to the Russian president.
If Putin was somehow responsible, Pomeranz said, it could show the long-time leader likely reasserting his grip on power by removing a rival.
Putin’s standing on the world stage has suffered after Ukrainian defenders slowed Russia’s invasion to a halt, after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian leader (preventing him from attending the BRICS summit alongside other heads of state) and with Russia’s moon lander crashing on Sunday, Pomeranz said.
He also suggested Russia’s security forces could be responsible for Prigozhin’s plane crashing.
“(The security services) are advocating for a stronger push in Ukraine,” he said.
“I think they are pushing for mobilization and I think they are pushing for tighter control of the Russian information space.”
If other actors in Russia besides Putin were responsible, Pomeranz told Global News, it would indicate Putin’s grasp on power is tenuous.
“I think Prigozhin’s death is yet another sign that Putin, Putin’s ability to stay in charge is limited and he will have to use all of his political acumen and his force and all of Russian state power in order to make sure that he stays on top.”
But he added it’s impossible to tell how strong Putin’s position is – and that any confirmation the crash was anything other than an accident is very unlikely.
“It would take an inside source to find out. And it’s very difficult to get access to an inside source who will actually spill the beans in terms of what happened.”
And he stressed Prigozhin’s death is yet to be confirmed.
Andrew Rasiulis with the Canadian Global Affairs Institute also emphasized the importance of sticking to the facts in this situation, as it will take time to identify the bodies in the wreckage and that the information comes amid reports a second plane registered to Prigozhin landed safely in Moscow around the time of the crash.
However, Rasiulis says it is logical to suspect potential Kremlin involvement if Prigozhin did in fact die in a plane crash.
“The fact is that there was this mutiny and then there was this deal made. And the question is, what is this a forever deal or a short-term deal?” he said.
“It’s complex in Moscow right now. I would not make any guesses there except to say that there are some very interesting power plays taking place.”
Putin, 70 and in power since 1999, is expected to run for another six-year presidential term in 2024. With Russia waging what he calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine and locked in what he describes as an existential battle with the West, Putin has said it is vital for the country to remain united.
Putin has crushed opposition to his leadership within Russia. He main political rival, Alexei Navalny – who survived an assassination attempt – had an extra 19 years added to his 11-1/2 years prison sentence on Aug. 4.
Navalny is already serving sentences on fraud and other charges that he says are bogus. His political movement has been outlawed and declared “extremist.”

Headline: Woman donates her womb to sister in first-ever U.K. transplant
Article Content:

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.
In a medical first for the U.K., surgeons in Oxford have successfully performed a womb transplant between two sisters. The complicated procedure is a form of fertility treatment expected to usher in a new era of child birthing possibilities.
The oldest sister, 40, is a living donor who had already birthed two children. She donated the organ to her 34-year-old sister, who was born with an undeveloped womb. The sisters, who are English, wished to remain anonymous.
Details of the surgery were published on Tuesday in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (BJOG). The surgeries were performed by a team at Churchill Hospital in Oxford in early 2023 as part of the U.K. living donor program.
The transplant implantation took more than nine hours to complete. Altogether, the operations on both sisters totalled around 17 hours and involved more than 30 staff members. Both women were well enough to leave the hospital after 10 days in care.
The sister who received the womb is “incredibly happy” and “over the moon” about the successful treatment, according to the charity Womb Transplant U.K., which paid for the procedure.
The recipient plans to use in vitro fertilization (IVF) in an attempt to have two children of her own.
Before the transplant, the sister who received the womb underwent several fertility treatments, including stimulation to generate eggs and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to produce embryos. The embryo transfer is expected to take place later this year, barring any complications.
Researchers have worked for the last 25 years to develop the womb transplant procedure, according to the NHS.
Co-lead surgeon Richard Smith said in a press release that the surgery was “only possible thanks to the recipient’s sister who came forward and was willing to donate.”
“It is still very early days but, if all continues to go well, we hope the recipient will continue to progress, and be in a position to have a baby in the coming years,” he said. “We are grateful to the charity Womb Transplant UK for funding the transplant and to our highly talented colleagues for their time and expertise over many years.”
Smith said future womb transplants will depend on the willingness of suitable donors and the availability of funding.
“However, we very much hope we will be able to help other women born without or with underdeveloped wombs in the near future,” Smith concluded.
According to the NHS, about 100 womb transplants have been performed globally, though this is a first for the U.K. Approximately 50 babies have reportedly been born as a result of womb transplants. The first successful womb transplant was carried out in 2013 in Sweden.
The Guardian reported that another U.K.-based womb transplant is already on the surgery docket for this fall. There are reportedly several other patients in the preparation stages for the same treatment, with 10 brain-dead donors and five living donors on standby.
The woman who received the womb was born with a rare condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH). MRKH, which sees children born without a functioning womb, is observed in an estimated one in 5,000 live female births. Many others may lose their wombs as a result of cancer or conditions like endometriosis.

Headline: Decades-old body of skier revealed as glacier rapidly melts in Austria

A glacier in Austria that has seen unprecedented melting in recent years has given up the body of a man believed to have died while skiing over 20 years ago.
A mountain guide found the remains of the man on Friday high up in the Austrian Alps on the Schlatenkees glacier, police said. The remains had clearly been there for some time, they added.
The guide called police in Lienz who were able to retrieve the body with a helicopter. The glacier is located in the Hohe Tauern national park in eastern Tyrol province, near the Italian border. The body was found at an altitude of about 2,900 metres.
A few metres below the body, rescuers discovered a backpack containing cash, a bank card and a driving licence. The man also had ski touring equipment with him. It’s believed he died in an accident on the glacier.
Police have tentatively identified the remains as belonging to an Austrian man who was 37 at the time. Authorities believe he died in 2001, meaning the man may have been encased in ice for 22 years.
DNA testing is being carried out to officially confirm the man’s identity, but those results are not expected for another few weeks, police said.
This discovery comes on the heels of other human remains that were found on the same glacier less than two months ago, AFP reported.
A group of alpinists found human remains and parts of skis on the Schlatenkees glacier in late June. Police believe these remains could also be decades old, though the body has yet to be identified.
“It is rather rare that human remains and an entire corpse are found on a glacier within such a short period of time,” Tyrol police spokesperson Christian Viehweider told AFP.
According to the Austrian Alpine Club’s annual report, Schlatenkees has seen the largest loss of ice out of all of Austria’s glaciers in recent years. During the 2021-22 reporting period, the glacier retreated 89.5 metres.
Since 2019, the glacier has receded up to 100 metres, according to data from Greenpeace Austria.
As glaciers increasingly melt and recede due to climate change, objects and human remains once lost to the ice can be revealed.
In 2011, bones were discovered on the Schlatenkees glacier that were believed to belong to a local man who went missing in 1957, more than 50 years prior.
Last month in neighbouring Switzerland, police said they found the body of a German mountaineer who disappeared in 1986 on a glacier near the Matterhorn.
A study published in Science early this year found that around half of the world’s glaciers could disappear by the end of the century, even if ambitious climate targets are met. If the world is able to cap global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 C — a target we are not on track to meet — the world’s glaciers could still lose about a quarter of their land mass.
Such a scenario would have wide-reaching effects on humans, as melting glaciers contribute to sea levels rising and nearly two billion people rely on glaciers for fresh drinking water.
Glaciologist Lindsey Nicholson at the University of Innsbruck told CNN that “glaciers are undergoing a long-term trend of melting.” This trend is expected to continue as each winter brings less and less snow to replenish what is melted away in the hotter seasons.
“The reduced snow amount is also partly coupled to the change in temperatures, because what happens is some of the precipitation that … would have come in the form of snow, now comes in the form of rain. That does not help the glaciers, it works against them,” she said.
“If we continue with the emissions we are transmitting now, we are looking at a largely deglaciated Alps region for generations to come – and that is very sad.”

Headline: At BRICS summit, Putin rails against West from afar as divisions emerge
Article Content:

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.
BRICS leaders met on Tuesday to plot the future course of the bloc of developing nations but divisions re-emerged ahead of a critical debate over a potential expansion of the group intended to boost its global clout.
Heightened tensions in the wake of the Ukraine war and Beijing’s growing rivalry with the United States have pushed China and Russia — whose President Vladimir Putin will attend the meeting virtually — to seek to strengthen BRICS.
They are seeking to use the Aug. 22-24 summit in Johannesburg to forge the grouping, which also includes South Africa, Brazil and India, into a counterweight to Western dominance of global institutions.
“Right now, changes in the world, in our times, and in history are unfolding in ways like never before, bringing human society to a critical juncture,” China’s President Xi Jinping said in remarks delivered at a BRICS business forum.
“The course of history will be shaped by the choices we make.”
Expansion has long been a goal of China, which hopes that broader membership will lend clout to a grouping already home to some 40% of the world’s population and a quarter of global gross domestic product.
Xi skipped the event, despite the presence there of counterparts Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
His remarks were delivered by Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, and it was not immediately clear why Xi, who had a meeting with host Ramaphosa earlier in the day, did not attend.
Comments from Brazil’s Lula pointed to a divergence of vision within the bloc, which political analysts say has long struggled to form a coherent view of its role in the global order.
“We do not want to be a counterpoint to the G7, G20 or the United States,” Brazil’s Lula said on Tuesday during a social media broadcast from Johannesburg. “We just want to organize ourselves.”
Beyond the enlargement question, boosting the use of member states’ local currencies in trade and financial transactions to lessen dependency of the U.S. dollar is also on the summit agenda.
“The objective, irreversible process of de-dollarization of our economic ties is gaining momentum,” Russia’s Putin said in a pre-recorded statement.
South African organizers say there will be no discussions however of a common BRICS currency, an idea floated by Brazil as an alternative to dollar-dependence.
Russia’s economy is grappling with Western sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Putin is wanted under an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, and is being represented at the summit by his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.
In his pre-recorded speech, Putin said the BRICS grouping of countries was on course to meet the aspirations of most of the world’s population.
“We cooperate on the principles of equality, partnership support, respect for each other’s interests, and this is the essence of the future-oriented strategic course of our association, a course that meets the aspirations of the main part of the world community, the so-called global majority,” Putin said.
He also railed against the West, criticizing what he called “illegitimate sanctions” on his country and threatening to cut off Ukraine’s grain exports permanently unless Russia’s conditions — the easing of restrictions on Russian food and agricultural products — are met.
BRICS remains a disparate group, ranging from China, the world’s second biggest economy, to South Africa, a relative minnow which is nonetheless Africa’s most developed economy.
Russia is keen to show the West it still has friends but India has increasingly reached out to the West, as has Brazil under its new leader.
India and China have also periodically clashed along their disputed border, adding to the challenge of decision-making in a group that relies on consensus.
Speaking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said he did not see BRICS turning into a geopolitical rival of the United States.
“This is a very diverse collection of countries … with differences of view on critical issues,” he said.
Russia is also keen to expand membership while South Africa’s President Ramaphosa voiced support for the idea at the meeting with Xi.
The BRICS leaders will hold a mini-retreat and dinner on Tuesday evening where they are likely to discuss a framework and criteria for admitting new countries.
India, which is wary of Chinese dominance and has warned against rushing expansion, has “positive intent and an open mind”, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said on Monday. Brazil, meanwhile, is concerned that expanding BRICS will dilute its influence, though Lula reiterated on Tuesday his desire to see neighbor Argentina join the bloc.
An Argentine government source involved in the country’s negotiations to join BRICS told Reuters that no new members were expected to be admitted to the bloc during the summit.
While a potential BRICS enlargement remains up in the air, the grouping’s pledge to become a champion of the developing world and offer an alternative to a world order dominated by wealthy Western nations is already finding resonance.
Over 40 countries have expressed interest in joining BRICS, say South African officials. Of them, nearly two dozen have formally asked to be admitted, with some expected to send delegations to Johannesburg.

Headline: Migrants believed dead in Greece wildfires that forced evacuations
Article Content:

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.
Firefighters on Tuesday found the burnt bodies of 18 people believed to have been migrants who had crossed the Turkish border into an area of northeastern Greece where wildfires have raged for days.
The discovery near the city of Alexandroupolis came as hundreds of firefighters battled dozens of wildfires across the country amid gale-force winds. On Monday, two people died and two firefighters were injured in separate fires in northern and central Greece.
With their hot, dry summers, southern European countries are particularly prone to wildfires. Another major blaze has been burning across Tenerife in Spain’s Canary Islands for a week, although no injuries or damage to homes was reported.
European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in Europe, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.
In Greece, police activated the country’s Disaster Victim Identification Team to identify the 18 bodies, which were found near a shack in the Avantas area, fire department spokesman Ioannis Artopios said.
“Given that there have been no reports of a missing person or missing residents from the surrounding areas, the possibility is being investigated that these are people who had entered the country illegally,” Artopios said.
Alexandroupolis is near the border with Turkey, along a route often taken by people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East, Asia and Africa and seeking to enter the European Union.
Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou expressed deep sorrow at the deaths.
“We must urgently take effective initiatives to ensure that this bleak reality does not become the new normality,” she said in a statement.
Avantas, like many nearby villages and settlements, had been under evacuation orders, with push alerts in Greek and English sent to all mobile phones in the region.
Overnight, a massive wall of flames raced through forests toward Alexandroupolis, prompting authorities to evacuate eight more villages and the city’s hospital as flames reddened the sky.
About 65 of the more than 100 patients in the hospital were transported to a ferry boat in the city’s port, while others were taken to other hospitals in northern Greece.
Deputy Health Minister Dimitris Vartzopoulos, speaking on Greece’s Skai television, said smoke and ash in the air around the Alexandrouplolis hospital were the main reasons behind the decision to evacuate the facility.
“We evacuated within four hours,” he said.
The coast guard said patrol boats and private vessels evacuated an additional 40 people by sea from beaches near Alexandroupolis.
In the northeastern Evros border region, a fire was burning through forest in a protected national park, with satellite imagery showing smoke blanketing much of northern and western Greece.
New fires broke out in several parts of the country Tuesday, including in woodland northwest of Athens and an industrial area on the capital’s western fringes.
Small explosions echoed from the industrial area of Aspropyrgos as flames reached warehouses and factories. Authorities shut down a highway and ordered the evacuation of nearby settlements.
With firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece appealed for help from the European Union’s civil protection mechanism.
Five water-dropping planes from Croatia, Germany and Sweden, and a helicopter, 58 firefighters and nine water tanks from the Czech Republic flew to Greece Tuesday, while 56 Romanian firefighters and two aircraft from Cyprus arrived Monday. French firefighters helped tackle a blaze on the island of Evia on Monday.
“We are mobilizing actually almost one-third of the aircraft we have in the rescEU fleet,” said EU spokesman Balazs Ujvari.
The fire risk level for several regions, including the wider Athens area, was listed as “extreme” for a second day Tuesday. Authorities banned public access to mountains and forests in those regions until at least Wednesday morning and ordered military patrols.
In Spain, firefighters battled to control a wildfire burning for a week on the popular Canary Islands tourist destination of Tenerife. It is estimated that the blaze, which has scorched 150 square kilometers (59 square miles), has already burnt a third of Tenerife’s woodlands.
More than 12,000 people were evacuated during the past week. Authorities said Tuesday that 1,500 have been able to return to their homes. Authorities have described the fire as the worst in decades on the Atlantic archipelago.
Large parts of Spain were under alert for wildfires as temperatures reached more than 38 C (100 F). While Spain’s south often has extremely high temperatures, the country’s weather agency issued an alert for the northern Basque Country, where temperatures were forecast to reach 42 degrees Celsius (107 degrees Fahrenheit) Wednesday.
Greece’s deadliest wildfire killed 104 people in 2018, at a seaside resort near Athens that residents had not been warned to evacuate. Authorities have since erred on the side of caution, issuing swift mass evacuation orders whenever inhabited areas are threatened.
Last month, a wildfire on the island of Rhodes forced the evacuation of some 20,000 tourists. Days later, two air force pilots were killed when their water-dropping plane crashed while diving low to tackle a blaze on Evia.
In Italy, authorities evacuated 700 people from homes and a campsite on the Tuscan island of Elba after a fire broke out late Monday, while in Turkey authorities evacuated nine villages in northwestern Canakkale province.
According to the Italian Society of Environmental Geology, more than 1,100 fires in Europe this summer have consumed 2,842 square kilometers (about 1,100 square miles), well above an average of 724 fires a year recorded from 2006-2022. The fires have removed wooded areas capable of absorbing 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.
“When we add the fires in Canada, the United States, Africa, Asia and Australia to those in Europe, it seems that the situation is getting worse every year,” said SIGEA president Antonello Fiore.

Headline: Fukushima fallout: Is Japan ‘irresponsible’ to dump treated nuclear wastewater?
Article Content:
Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first.
If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.
Japan will begin dumping more than one million metric tonnes of treated radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean Thursday – a highly controversial move the government says is essential to shut down the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant.
The Japanese government announced the decision Tuesday. The plan, approved two years ago by Japan as crucial to decommissioning the plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), has faced criticism from neighbouring nations and local fishing groups, who fear reputational damage and a threat to their livelihood.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida instructed TEPCO to be ready to start the coastal release Thursday if weather and sea conditions permit.
Japan has said the water release is safe, but some environmental activists have argued that not all the possible impacts have been studied.
Here’s what you need to know.
Thursday’s dumping dates back to March 11, 2011.
A massive earthquake and tsunami destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi plant’s cooling systems, causing three of its reactors to melt and contaminating the cooling water.
The water, now amounting to 1.34 million tonnes, is collected, filtered and stored in about 1,000 tanks, which fill much of the plant’s grounds and will reach their capacity in early 2024.
Junichi Matsumoto, TEPCO executive in charge of the water release, told The Associated Press last month that the release is “a milestone,” but is still only an initial step in a daunting decommissioning process.
The government and TEPCO have said the water will be treated and then diluted with seawater to levels safer than international standards. TEPCO plans to release 7,800 tonnes of treated water in the 17-day first round of the release, Matsumoto said.
TEPCO then plans to release 31,200 tonnes of the treated water by the end of March 2024, which would empty only 10 tanks at the site. The pace will pick up later.
The seawater and marine life will be tested and the results will be disclosed on government and TEPCO websites.
In a final report released in July, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found that the release, if conducted as designed, will cause negligible impact on the environment and human health.
After taking into account possible bioconcentration of low-dose radionuclides that still remain in the water, the environmental and health impact is still negligible, TEPCO officials said.
Most scientists support the IAEA’s view, but some say the long-term impact of the low-dose radioactivity that remains in the water needs attention.
Greenpeace said on Tuesday that the radiological risks have not been fully assessed and that the biological impacts of tritium, carbon-14, strontium-90 and iodine-129 – which will be released with the water – “have been ignored.”
The filtering process will remove strontium-90 and iodine-129, and the concentration of carbon-14 in the contaminated water is far lower than its regulatory standard for discharge, according to TEPCO and Japanese government documents.
Japan’s government will take “appropriate measures, including immediate suspension of the discharge” if unusually high concentrations of radioactive materials are detected, the document said.
TEPCO has been engaging with fishing communities and other stakeholders and is promoting agriculture, fishery and forest products in stores and restaurants to reduce any reputational harm to produce from the area.
Fishing unions in Fukushima have urged the government for years not to release the water, arguing it would undo work to restore the damaged reputation of their fisheries.
China has called Japan’s plan irresponsible, unpopular and unilateral.
China is the biggest importer of Japanese seafood.
Shortly after the 2011 disaster, China banned imports of food and agricultural products from five Japanese prefectures. China later widened its ban to cover 10 out of Japan’s 47 prefectures.
China again imposed import restrictions in July after the IAEA approved Japan’s plans to discharge the treated water.
Striking a similar tone, Hong Kong’s leader said Tuesday that he strongly opposed Japan’s water release, and the city would “immediately activate” import controls on Japanese seafood.
The government of the Asian financial hub said Hong Kong’s ban would take effect from Aug. 24, the day Japan starts its release.
The gambling hub of Macau will also implement the ban from Thursday, covering goods from the same 10 Japanese regions.
Meanwhile, South Korea said on Tuesday that it sees no problem with the scientific or technical aspects of Japan’s plan, but it does not necessarily support it.
The administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol has faced a fine line over the issue as it seeks to improve relations with Japan, while the risk of a broader consumer backlash persists at home.
The country’s opposition Democratic Party, however, said on Tuesday that its “battle” to stop the release would continue, calling Japan’s plan “selfish and irresponsible.”

UPDATE: Pakistani rescuers pulled eight people, including six children, to safety after their cable car became stranded high over a remote ravine on Tuesday, ending an ordeal that lasted more than 15 hours.
The high-risk operation in a mountainous region of north Pakistan was completed in the darkness of night after the cable car snagged early in the morning, leaving it hanging from a single rope at an angle all day. The initial helicopter rescue mission was abandoned as the light faded and the rescue was completed in a ground-based operation, Reuters reported.
“It was a unique operation that required lots of skill,” the military said in a statement.
“All the kids have been successfully and safely rescued,” caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar said in a post on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
“Great team work by the military, rescue departments, district administration as well as the local people.”
Relieved to know that Alhamdolillah all the kids have been successfully and safely rescued. Great team work by the military, rescue departments, district administration as well as the local people. 🇵🇰 https://t.co/2gPq2Q51Xi

ORIGINAL: A high-stakes rescue mission is underway in a remote part of Pakistan Tuesday after six children and two adults were stranded in a cable car dangling high above a ravine.
The children and adults were on their way to a school in the mountainous Battagram district when one of the lines of the cable car system snapped, leaving them suspended by a single rope about 275 metres in the air.
Rescue attempts by military commandos in helicopters have been hampered by strong winds in the river canyon, made worse by the wind created by the helicopters’ blades. Photos and videos from the scene showed soldiers descending on ropes from a helicopter, attempting to reach the cable car.
The group has been stranded since 7 a.m. local time (10 p.m. Eastern). At around 7 p.m. local time, about 12 hours into the group’s ordeal, officials gave word that the first rescues had been made.
Four children have been successfully retrieved from the cable car, one by one, rescuers told Reuters. Officials are still working to save the remaining two children and two adults on board.
Television footage showed one child being lifted off the cable car by a helicopter in a harness and then carried to the ground.
The BBC reported that one of the boys trapped in the cable car has a heart condition and fell unconscious hours into the ordeal. It’s unknown if this boy was among the four children rescued thus far.
“Our situation is precarious. For God’s sake, do something,” Gulfaraz, a 20-year-old on the cable car, told local television channel Geo News over the phone, appealing to authorities to rescue them as soon as possible. He said the children were aged between 10 and 15.
Crowds of villagers gathered on the hillside anxiously watching the operation unfold alongside relatives of those trapped. The rescue has also transfixed Pakistanis across the country who crowded around televisions in offices, shops, restaurants and hospitals.
According to Pakistani TV stations, some of those trapped were in contact with their families by cellphone.
Travelling by cable car in Pakistan’s mountainous regions is not uncommon. But the cars are often poorly maintained and every year people die or are injured while travelling in them.
According to Taimoor Khan, a spokesman for the disaster management authority, helicopters were sent to rescue the group after they had already been trapped for six hours.
Pakistan’s caretaker prime minister, Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he ordered authorities “to urgently ensure safe rescue and evacuation of the 8 people.”
“I have also directed the authorities to conduct safety inspections of all such private chairlifts and ensure that they are safe to operate and use,” he said.
The chairlift accident in Battagram, KP is really alarming. I have directed the NDMA, PDMA and district authorities to urgently ensure safe rescue and evacuation of the 8 people stuck in the chairlift.I have also directed the authorities to conduct safety inspections of all such…

In 2017, 10 people were killed when a cable car fell into a ravine hundreds of metres deep in the popular mountain resort of Murree after its cable broke.

Headline: Canada ‘likely at the start’ of new COVID-19 wave. How big will it get?
Article Content:

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.
Canada is likely at the start of a new wave of COVID-19, but how bad it will be is unknown, some health experts say.
The turn comes after months of low transmission of the virus, which continues to mutate and has recently spawned two variants — EG.5, a subvariant of Omicron, and BA.2.86 — that have captured the attention of scientists.
“We’re starting to see an uptick in cases after a pretty long decline. We saw really an impressive drop in the number of infections that started right at the end of 2022 and continued to all the way to the middle of this summer,” Dr. Fahad Razak, a professor at the University of Toronto and internal medicine physician at St. Michael’s Hospital, told Global News Wednesday.
“Over the last few weeks, we’ve started to see that rise again … It’s that expected rise. I think nothing of that is surprising to any of us that, after a period of decline as the virus continues to mutate, you’ll have a period where you start to have that increase again.”
Dr. Jesse Papenburg, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Montreal Children’s Hospital of the McGill University Health Centre, shared similar sentiments with Global News earlier this month.
“I think most people expect that there will be a certain amount of seasonality to COVID-19, and we do expect that the case counts will rise in the fall and winter,” he said.
“How much of a surge it will be remains to be seen.”
With two new COVID-19 lineages emerging just before the fall — a season when respiratory viruses thrive — Razak is warning Canadians to stay vigilant.
According to latest federal wastewater data, 10 regions reported an increase in COVID-19 activity. The latest data was updated Aug. 22 and contained information up to and including Aug. 15.
Regions that reported increases include Bridgewater, N.S., St. John’s, N.L. and Edmonton, Alta. At least nine regions reported decreases, while 20 sites showed no change in data.
In terms of reported new infections, Canada logged 2,071 in the week of Aug. 6 to 12. However, case counts remain underestimated due to changes in reporting since at least December 2021, Ottawa states.
Scientists, meanwhile, continue to closely monitor the virus and two of its variants, EG.5, a subvariant of Omicron, and BA.2.86, a mutation that so far appears distinct from its likely parents, including the currently-dominant XBB.1.5 variant of Omicron, which itself was much more transmissible and deadly than the original strain of SARS-CoV-2.
There is much to learn about both variants, but the World Health Organization has labelled E.G5 as a “variant of interest” and BA.2.86 a “variant under monitoring.”
“Public Health Agency of Canada scientists, along with national and international experts, are actively monitoring and evaluating BA.2.86 lineages,” a Health Canada spokesperson told Global News in a statement Friday.
As of Friday, “there have been no detections of the BA.2.86 lineage in Canada,” spokesperson Anna Maddison said.
Canada’s infection increase coincides with an erosion in immune protection and cooler weather, where more Canadians will be inside — an environment prime for respiratory viruses.
“My expectation is that after seeing a pretty long period of declining COVID numbers, we’ll start to see that uptick now heading into the fall and winter,” Razak said.
“We are likely at the start of a new wave here. … how big it will be remains unknown.”
Despite an overall slowing of COVID activity over the past year, new data highlights the impact the virus continues to have on hospitals.
The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) released data Wednesday showing COVID-19 hospitalizations increased by 19 per cent between April 2022 to March 2023. During that time frame, there were more than 120,000 hospital stays, an increase from 101,000 the previous year.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 emergency department visits were down. Emergency departments in Canada logged 222,000 COVID-19 visits between April 2022 to March 2023, down from 262,000 visits the year prior. CIHI noted its data excludes Quebec.
“As we move out of the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to impact hospitals and EDs across the country,” said Juliana Wu, director of acute and ambulatory care information services with CIHI.
CIHI said of the 2022-23 COVID-19 hospitalizations, most patients were older with the median age being 75, compared with 63 the previous year.
Ninety per cent of emergency visits were completed within 25 hours, an increase from 15 hours the year before. The majority of patients (69 per cent) who went to emergency were discharged home, while 26 per cent were admitted to hospital.
More than half (62 per cent) of patients admitted to hospital were discharged home, while 10 per cent died in the facility. The average length of stay in hospital increased to 20 days from 13 the previous year, CIHI noted.
Thirteen per cent of hospital stays included an ICU admission. Among those patients with ICU stays, 39 per cent received ventilation and 23 per cent died in the facility.
“COVID remains a major issue still in hospitals,” Razak said.
“That severe respiratory COVID infection phase, we’re really not seeing that very much anymore, but COVID infecting people and causing problems still as exacerbating illnesses, causing people to be sick enough that they end up in hospital, that it still is occurring.”
In addition to cooler weather, more Canadians will be heading indoors at they to return to work in offices for the first time in three years.
Statistics Canada released a report Tuesday that showed that nearly 16 million Canadians — or four in five employees — commuted to work in May. This represents a 4.8 per cent increase compared with last year and a 26.2 per cent jump from 2021.
Some institutions are already taking measures to stop the spread of COVID as cases emerge.
In the United States, Hollywood film studio Lionsgate recently reinstated its mask mandate for its employees given a rise in COVID-19 cases, The Hollywood Reporter and The Guardian report.
Morris Brown College, a private school in Atlanta, Ga., said in an Instagram post it was reinstating its mask mandate due to reports of positive cases.
Razak is advising Canadians to stay up-to-date on their vaccinations and to mask up in high-risk settings. He also recommended better air quality in buildings.
“We want society to move away from the severe disruptions we experienced the last few years and get back to all of those things we value,” he said.
In its latest COVID-19 vaccination guidance published last month, Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended all Canadians aged five years and up get a COVID-19 booster in the fall if it has been at least six months since their last vaccine dose or infection, whichever is later.
A bivalent vaccine that targets Omicron is currently available to Canadians, but NACI anticipates that the new vaccine formulations could be available this fall.
While an Omicron vaccine is ideal, any booster that is available is going to be effective at reducing infection, Dr. Prabhat Jha, an epidemiologist at Unity Health Toronto, told Global News earlier this month.

Headline: Ontario ‘miracle’ woman wakes up from coma just days before her wedding

Sarah Kempinska spent two years planning her wedding but whether it would go ahead remained uncertain until the very week of the event, with the bride unconscious in a London, Ont., hospital.
Kempinska had routine surgeries to remove growths in her airways as part of treatment for Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, an autoimmune condition involving the immune system attacking small blood vessels in the body. In her case, it impacts her lungs and airway.
The surgeries, which are handled by her primary care team outside of London, typically see her discharged from hospital the very same day.
“I was not expecting a long recovery,” she explained, “but with this last surgery, you know, this is kind of a complicated disease and we didn’t really expect there to be this complication.”
Soon after the procedure, Kempinska could tell something wasn’t quite right. When she arrived back in London, she was struggling to breathe and ended up going to the emergency department at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) on May 23.
She was admitted for monitoring but when her breathing worsened, she was taken to the operating room and transferred to the critical care and trauma centre where she was intubated and placed in a medically-induced coma.
Her wedding, meanwhile, was supposed to be held June 3.
“I had all of the details meticulously laid out in spreadsheets and contact lists and payments for vendors all laid out. And I think it was all on my phone for the most part. So (my fiancé) Jim had to get a hold of that. And I was, of course, asleep in a coma,” she said.
“He actually used my fingerprint to get into my phone and get all of that stuff and make sure that he could contact the vendors.”
While Jim Kelly, a radio personality with FM96 – a station owned by Corus Entertainment which also owns Global News – helped keep plans afloat, hospital staff were doing what they could to give the bride-to-be her best shot at walking down the aisle as scheduled.
“I didn’t know what was going on, but they were washing and braiding my hair to make sure it was not getting matted before the wedding day. And when they put in a central line (for the IV), they made sure to watch where to put it so it wasn’t going to affect my neckline of my dress,” she said.
“Little things like that they really didn’t have to do, but just went the extra mile.”
One nursing staff member even wrote her a letter that was put in an envelope stating not to read until her wedding day.
While she did not divulge the exact contents of the letter, she said it “brought everything full circle” and reminded her of all the support she received.
“I have it framed now. It’s such a special piece.”
It was a particularly unique experience for one LHSC staff member, Kempinska’s sister Anna Kempinska, an emergency department physician at LHSC’s Children’s Hospital.
“Usually when I come in the doors of the hospital, I turn right to go to work,” she said.
“This time I was turning left to go to the resuscitation room to be with Sarah. And I think as a medical professional, you know the worst of the worst, you know what could happen and so it was very unsettling to be so out of control.”
Anna Kempinska helped to explain the complicated medical information to their large, supportive family, adding that as important as the wedding was, her sister’s health was the priority.
“We just wanted Sarah to get better and get her out of the hospital. But, you know, one minute you would sort of be trying to help plan this wedding that Sarah had spent two years planning for. And then the next minute our family would look at each other and say, ‘there’s no way this wedding is going to happen.’”
But with just four days to go before saying “I do,” Kempinska awoke from her coma. At that point, she was using a walker and was exhausted after taking 10 steps on her own.
“The nursing staff were amazing at helping me through that and the physiotherapist as well, but it was all just up in the air. About maybe three days before the wedding, Jim and I were on the phone with the wedding venue talking about alternative dates because we just didn’t know if it was going to happen,” she explained.
“But ultimately, I just remember looking at Jim and saying, ‘I just want to be married to you.’”
Kempinska was released from the hospital on May 30 and married June 3. She required some assistance but was able to walk down the aisle and even dance a little.
In retrospect, LHSC says it’s now believed that the impacts of the disease were worse than first thought when Kempinska’s surgery was conducted, which also occurred after a longer time frame than before due to the pandemic. Additionally, LHSC says that the medications she was on may not have been working as well as they should have.
Going forward, “better medical control will be explored” ahead of future surgeries to lessen the risk of complications, LHSC says.
Kempinska says there is no cure, but she is lucky to have teams of doctors monitoring her situation. She added that she’s just finished another treatment that appears to have gone well and she is “happily married and feeling very good.”
“It’s been kind of a miracle looking back at how it all went down.”

One person has died after the transport truck they were driving fell through a road in southwest Middlesex County on Wednesday night.
Emergency crews were called to Dundonald Road just after 10 p.m. for a reported single vehicle collision.
In a video posted to Twitter Thursday morning, Provincial Const. Jeff Hare said that a transport truck had fallen through the road.
“Unfortunately, the driver succumbed to his injuries at the scene,” he said.
The driver was identified only as a 59-year-old from Mississauga, Ont.
While the investigation is ongoing, Hare noted that the crash came as the region experienced heavy rainfall.
Hare explained that due to “unprecedented storms” that came through the area, “the flooding, according to what some people are saying around here, was monumental.”
Some parts of southwestern Ontario were under various special weather statements and severe thunderstorm warnings on Wednesday as large amounts of rain fell throughout the day.
#MiddlesexOPP @MLPS911 & @SouthwestMiddl1 fire responded to a single veh collision on Dundonald Rd last night. Unfortunately, the driver died as a result of injuries sustained in the collision.

Chris Traini, county engineer with the County of Middlesex, says there is currently “no indication” that there was “any deficiency of the road,” based on previous road patrol reports.
“There are a number of reasons why the road could wash out and we will have to go in there and determine that,” he said, noting that the county will conduct an internal investigation focusing on the engineering of the road.
The section of road where the washout occurred falls under the county’s jurisdiction. He said road staff follow legislative requirements to inspect the roads on a regular basis.
He also stressed that the county road system is “structurally sound across the board” under typical conditions and even under some extreme conditions.
“I would tell the public that they should have confidence that the road infrastructure in Middlesex County is well maintained, in excellent condition and designed to handle the type of traffic we would expect in an agricultural community, heavy vehicles and transport trucks and passenger vehicles for sure,” he explained.
“But again, when we talk about these extreme weather events, whether it’s, you know, a blizzard, a tornado or an extreme rain event and a flood, drivers need to proceed with caution because we cannot design infrastructure to withstand some of these acts of God or these very extreme weather events.”
Dundonald Road will be closed between Buttonwood Drive and Carolinian Drive for the next couple of weeks as crews work to repair.
“We are experiencing other shut downs as well due to flooding and the roads being washed out,” Hare said. “What we’re asking is that everybody be patient while the roads get replaced and fixed.
“It’s obviously a hard day for everybody involved… Our deepest sympathies and condolences to the family and the first responders that were involved last night,” he added.

Headline: B.C. wildfires: Why some British Columbians say they won’t leave the fire zone
Article Content:
Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first.
If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.
North Shuswap resident Kyle Boppre offers a simple explanation when asked why he defied an evacuation order issued as a wildfire bore down on his neighbourhood.
“It’s just, I guess, in my blood to fight,” he said. “We were able to save our home.”
Boppre and others in the small communities that dot the Shuswap region’s waterfront felt like they were on their own, with no choice but to take the firefight into their own hands.
But authorities say that their actions put their lives at risk and imperil firefighting strategies. Emergency Management Minister Bowinn Ma said Wednesday the unwanted presence of evacuation scofflaws could prevent tactics such as water-bombing or controlled burns.
The 410-square-kilometre Bush Creek East in the Shuswap has resulted in evacuation orders being placed on more than 3,000 properties.
Most evacuation orders have been obeyed, but holdouts like Boppre and others stayed to fight the fires and believe the official response has been inadequate, incompetent, or non-existent.
It’s not just officials who are unimpressed.
Trent Tucker, a professor at Thompson Rivers University, lost his home to the fires near Little Shuswap Lake.
He said it’s entirely irresponsible for people to stay back in evacuation order zones, and he’s “extremely upset” by stories “lionizing” those who have defied evacuation orders.
“Our home is completely gone and yet we have these dummies that stuck around behind and the news is treating them like some sort of heroes,” he said.
“They got lucky it wasn’t like the case in West Kelowna where people stayed back and then they had to get rescued behind fire lines by firefighters.”
Boppre blames authorities.
He said a friend who tried to return to the area to join the fire fight encountered a police roadblock and when he tried to turn around he was chased down, his truck confiscated, and he was not allowed to return to his property in an evacuation zone.
The truck was filled with supplies including food, water, and gasoline, and he was “clearly not a criminal,” Boppre said.
“The government folks, the provincial folks that are trying to quote unquote save our properties,” he added. “Clearly they’re not here.”
Boppre, who runs a marine maintenance and scuba diving business, said members of the community have local knowledge of the geography, but officials from outside don’t seem to value it.
The community bonds are extremely strong among those who’ve stayed behind, Boppre said.
“We can’t wait around for that help that’s supposed to be here and watch our homes burn,” he said. “If I did evacuate when they wanted me to, (I) definitely would have lost my entire livelihood.”
Ma said that she recognized how difficult it is for people to leave their homes, but stressed the importance of following evacuation orders.
“Evacuation orders must be followed. They are not suggestions, they are the law,” she said. “When unauthorized people are in evacuation areas, it escalates the danger involved for everyone.”
Ron Jules, an elder with the Adams Lake Indian Band, lives down river from the community of Chase.
Jules, like Boppre, stayed behind despite an evacuation order and kept a sprinkler going on his roof.
“We can’t evacuate because we have to look after our home,” he said, calling it “all we got.”
Jules said the band had put sprinklers on several community buildings including the school and health centre. He estimated about 70 per cent of the community complied with the evacuation order.
At a Columbia Shuswap Regional District briefing in Salmon Arm, board chairman Kevin Flynn said “it’s inexcusable” that people are staying behind in the evacuation zones and tampering with equipment.
Flynn said there were reports that sprinklers protecting a wooden bridge in the Shuswap area were removed at least three times.
“I just can’t imagine anybody would think that is the right thing to do,” he said. “That is dangerous.”
Forrest Tower with the BC Wildfire Service said Tuesday that the Shuswap area fire quickly turned into an inferno, likely never before witnessed in B.C.
“This is one of, if not the most, significant fire events we have ever witnessed in B.C.,” he said. “We had a fire that went from a 7,000-hectare fire, that went 20 kilometres south in under 12 hours and is now a 41,000-hectare fire. That is a force of nature similar to a tornado, similar to an earthquake or a tsunami.”
Tower urged residents to leave firefighting equipment where it is.
“We have to have that equipment, the pumps, the hoses, the sprinklers, all that has to be there,” he said. “That gear, you might think you are doing something to help yourself, your neighbours, others, but I would really just urge if you could leave it to the professionals. They do have a plan.”

Headline: Millennials set to face most economic pain in months ahead, RBC says. Here’s why

Canadian millennials, particularly those who own a home, are set to face steep interest costs and economic damage in the months ahead, according to a new report from RBC.
Rising interest rates are set to ratchet up the pain on millennials and younger Generation X adults, RBC argues, leaving them especially vulnerable to job losses should the economy slow sharply in the months ahead.
Debt loads are particularly straining on core-age working adults compared with two decades earlier, RBC economist Carrie Freestone argued in the report released Wednesday.
Older millennials, adults aged 35 to 44, had debt-to-disposable income ratios around 250 per cent in 2019, while Freestone noted that metric was roughly 150 per cent for the same age group in 1999.
Younger indebted millennials — those under age 35 — had debt loads worth 165 per cent of their disposable income in 2019. Meanwhile, the country’s youngest cohort hasn’t seen a material rise in debt-to-income ratio since the late ’90s, RBC says, while noting only about one-third of that group has a mortgage.
“The millennial generation has in many ways been defined by its staggeringly high household debt,” Freestone wrote.
The debt situation has only worsened for many Canadians since 2019, as low interest rates during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed many young first-time buyers to enter the hot housing market, saddling owners with mortgages.
Statistics Canada says household debt-to-disposable income rose to 184.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, up from 181.7 per cent last quarter. That means there’s $1.85 in credit market debt for every dollar of household disposable income.
While not every millennial owns their home, those who do are especially vulnerable to the higher interest rate environment, which has seen the Bank of Canada’s policy rate rise 4.75 percentage points from the pandemic-era lows.
RBC expects the average Canadian renewing their mortgage could see their monthly payments jump by 25 per cent by early 2024, based on today’s rates for a typical five-year term.
The problem, Freestone explained, is that incomes haven’t kept pace to absorb the pending mortgage shock. The average hourly income has risen 12 per cent since the start of the pandemic, marking less than half the expected jump in mortgage payments.
The end result? RBC expects that consumption in this middle demographic will take a substantial hit this fall, particularly if millennial and younger Gen X workers are struck by job losses.
“While growth is still holding up even after record rate hikes, higher unemployment rates may trigger an entirely different outcome for demand in the year ahead,” Freestone wrote.
Many economists expect Canada’s economy to slow and the job losses to rise this fall as the lagged impact of higher interest rates starts to bite.
CIBC said in a report released Tuesday that it expects the unemployment rate to creep above 6.0 per cent, up from 5.5 per cent in July, by early 2024. The jobless rate has been rising steadily over the summer, up from near-record lows of 5.0 per cent at the start of the year.
The CIBC report said signs of easing in the labour market this summer should be sufficient to keep the central bank from hiking at its next rate decision on Sept. 6.
If unemployment rises according to its forecast, that could even convince the Bank of Canada to start cutting interest rates as early as the first quarter of 2024, CIBC argued.

Headline: Teen who killed boyfriend in 160 km/h crash sentenced for murder in Ohio

A 19-year-old from Ohio may spend the rest of her life behind bars after she was convicted and sentenced for intentionally crashing her car into a brick wall at 160 km/h (100 mph), killing her boyfriend and a friend.
Mackenzie Shirilla was only 17 years old on the night she crashed her Camry into the side of a commercial building outside Cleveland. Prosecutors argued at her murder trial that the teen had a toxic relationship with her boyfriend, 20-year-old Dominic Russo, and deliberately drove into the brick wall to end their relationship.
In doing so, “she took everybody that was in the car with her,” Tim Troup of the Cuyahoga County prosecutor’s office said. This included Russo’s friend Davion Flanagan, 19.
Both men were pronounced dead at the scene following the wreck. Shirilla was hospitalized.
Shirilla was handed two concurrent life sentences with the possibility of parole after 15 years at her sentencing hearing Monday. Last week, she was found guilty of four counts each of murder and felonious assault, as well as aggravated vehicular homicide and other crimes.
The 19-year-old didn’t testify at her trial, but Shirilla did tearfully read a statement to the families of the victims at her sentencing, saying she couldn’t recall what happened that night in July 2022.
“I hope one day you can see I would never let this happen or do it on purpose,” she said. “I wish I could remember what happened. I’m just so sorry. I’m heartbroken. … I wish I could take all your pain away.”
A video of the final seconds before the deadly crash was showed as evidence during Shirilla’s trial, showing her Camry accelerating down a street before careening into a building, with no signs of slowing down.
Common Pleas Court Judge Nancy Margaret Russo said this video was pivotal in delivering her verdict, calling Shirilla’s actions “controlled, methodical, deliberate, intentional and purposeful.”
“This was not reckless driving. This was murder,” Russo said.
“She morphs from responsible driver to literal hell on wheels,” the judge added, according to Cleveland.com.
Prosecutors argued during the murder trial that Shirilla had made violent threats against her boyfriend in the past, including threatening to break into his home and key his car. On one occasion, two weeks before the wreck, she threatened to crash her car with him in it.
The couple allegedly broke up and fought often, according to witness testimonies.
Meanwhile, defence lawyer James McDonnell said prosecutors had no evidence that Shirilla meant to kill her two passengers or what was going on in the car in the seconds leading up to the crash.
Judge Russo said during Monday’s sentencing hearing that she was sparing the defendant consecutive sentences in the two deaths but didn’t believe Shirilla would get parole in 15 years — and there was “a very good likelihood” Shirilla could spend the rest of her life in prison, depending on her conduct and the parole board’s decision.

Headline: Canada ‘likely at the start’ of new COVID-19 wave. How big will it get?

Canada is likely at the start of a new wave of COVID-19, but how bad it will be is unknown, some health experts say.
The turn comes after months of low transmission of the virus, which continues to mutate and has recently spawned two variants — EG.5, a subvariant of Omicron, and BA.2.86 — that have captured the attention of scientists.
“We’re starting to see an uptick in cases after a pretty long decline. We saw really an impressive drop in the number of infections that started right at the end of 2022 and continued to all the way to the middle of this summer,” Dr. Fahad Razak, a professor at the University of Toronto and internal medicine physician at St. Michael’s Hospital, told Global News Wednesday.
“Over the last few weeks, we’ve started to see that rise again … It’s that expected rise. I think nothing of that is surprising to any of us that, after a period of decline as the virus continues to mutate, you’ll have a period where you start to have that increase again.”
Dr. Jesse Papenburg, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Montreal Children’s Hospital of the McGill University Health Centre, shared similar sentiments with Global News earlier this month.
“I think most people expect that there will be a certain amount of seasonality to COVID-19, and we do expect that the case counts will rise in the fall and winter,” he said.
“How much of a surge it will be remains to be seen.”
With two new COVID-19 lineages emerging just before the fall — a season when respiratory viruses thrive — Razak is warning Canadians to stay vigilant.
According to latest federal wastewater data, 10 regions reported an increase in COVID-19 activity. The latest data was updated Aug. 22 and contained information up to and including Aug. 15.
Regions that reported increases include Bridgewater, N.S., St. John’s, N.L. and Edmonton, Alta. At least nine regions reported decreases, while 20 sites showed no change in data.
In terms of reported new infections, Canada logged 2,071 in the week of Aug. 6 to 12. However, case counts remain underestimated due to changes in reporting since at least December 2021, Ottawa states.
Scientists, meanwhile, continue to closely monitor the virus and two of its variants, EG.5, a subvariant of Omicron, and BA.2.86, a mutation that so far appears distinct from its likely parents, including the currently-dominant XBB.1.5 variant of Omicron, which itself was much more transmissible and deadly than the original strain of SARS-CoV-2.
There is much to learn about both variants, but the World Health Organization has labelled E.G5 as a “variant of interest” and BA.2.86 a “variant under monitoring.”
“Public Health Agency of Canada scientists, along with national and international experts, are actively monitoring and evaluating BA.2.86 lineages,” a Health Canada spokesperson told Global News in a statement Friday.
As of Friday, “there have been no detections of the BA.2.86 lineage in Canada,” spokesperson Anna Maddison said.
Canada’s infection increase coincides with an erosion in immune protection and cooler weather, where more Canadians will be inside — an environment prime for respiratory viruses.
“My expectation is that after seeing a pretty long period of declining COVID numbers, we’ll start to see that uptick now heading into the fall and winter,” Razak said.
“We are likely at the start of a new wave here. … how big it will be remains unknown.”
Despite an overall slowing of COVID activity over the past year, new data highlights the impact the virus continues to have on hospitals.
The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) released data Wednesday showing COVID-19 hospitalizations increased by 19 per cent between April 2022 to March 2023. During that time frame, there were more than 120,000 hospital stays, an increase from 101,000 the previous year.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 emergency department visits were down. Emergency departments in Canada logged 222,000 COVID-19 visits between April 2022 to March 2023, down from 262,000 visits the year prior. CIHI noted its data excludes Quebec.
“As we move out of the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to impact hospitals and EDs across the country,” said Juliana Wu, director of acute and ambulatory care information services with CIHI.
CIHI said of the 2022-23 COVID-19 hospitalizations, most patients were older with the median age being 75, compared with 63 the previous year.
Ninety per cent of emergency visits were completed within 25 hours, an increase from 15 hours the year before. The majority of patients (69 per cent) who went to emergency were discharged home, while 26 per cent were admitted to hospital.
More than half (62 per cent) of patients admitted to hospital were discharged home, while 10 per cent died in the facility. The average length of stay in hospital increased to 20 days from 13 the previous year, CIHI noted.
Thirteen per cent of hospital stays included an ICU admission. Among those patients with ICU stays, 39 per cent received ventilation and 23 per cent died in the facility.
“COVID remains a major issue still in hospitals,” Razak said.
“That severe respiratory COVID infection phase, we’re really not seeing that very much anymore, but COVID infecting people and causing problems still as exacerbating illnesses, causing people to be sick enough that they end up in hospital, that it still is occurring.”
In addition to cooler weather, more Canadians will be heading indoors at they to return to work in offices for the first time in three years.
Statistics Canada released a report Tuesday that showed that nearly 16 million Canadians — or four in five employees — commuted to work in May. This represents a 4.8 per cent increase compared with last year and a 26.2 per cent jump from 2021.
Some institutions are already taking measures to stop the spread of COVID as cases emerge.
In the United States, Hollywood film studio Lionsgate recently reinstated its mask mandate for its employees given a rise in COVID-19 cases, The Hollywood Reporter and The Guardian report.
Morris Brown College, a private school in Atlanta, Ga., said in an Instagram post it was reinstating its mask mandate due to reports of positive cases.
Razak is advising Canadians to stay up-to-date on their vaccinations and to mask up in high-risk settings. He also recommended better air quality in buildings.
“We want society to move away from the severe disruptions we experienced the last few years and get back to all of those things we value,” he said.
In its latest COVID-19 vaccination guidance published last month, Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended all Canadians aged five years and up get a COVID-19 booster in the fall if it has been at least six months since their last vaccine dose or infection, whichever is later.
A bivalent vaccine that targets Omicron is currently available to Canadians, but NACI anticipates that the new vaccine formulations could be available this fall.
While an Omicron vaccine is ideal, any booster that is available is going to be effective at reducing infection, Dr. Prabhat Jha, an epidemiologist at Unity Health Toronto, told Global News earlier this month.

Headline: Ontario ‘miracle’ woman wakes up from coma just days before her wedding
Article Content:

Sarah Kempinska spent two years planning her wedding but whether it would go ahead remained uncertain until the very week of the event, with the bride unconscious in a London, Ont., hospital.
Kempinska had routine surgeries to remove growths in her airways as part of treatment for Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, an autoimmune condition involving the immune system attacking small blood vessels in the body. In her case, it impacts her lungs and airway.
The surgeries, which are handled by her primary care team outside of London, typically see her discharged from hospital the very same day.
“I was not expecting a long recovery,” she explained, “but with this last surgery, you know, this is kind of a complicated disease and we didn’t really expect there to be this complication.”
Soon after the procedure, Kempinska could tell something wasn’t quite right. When she arrived back in London, she was struggling to breathe and ended up going to the emergency department at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) on May 23.
She was admitted for monitoring but when her breathing worsened, she was taken to the operating room and transferred to the critical care and trauma centre where she was intubated and placed in a medically-induced coma.
Her wedding, meanwhile, was supposed to be held June 3.
“I had all of the details meticulously laid out in spreadsheets and contact lists and payments for vendors all laid out. And I think it was all on my phone for the most part. So (my fiancé) Jim had to get a hold of that. And I was, of course, asleep in a coma,” she said.
“He actually used my fingerprint to get into my phone and get all of that stuff and make sure that he could contact the vendors.”
While Jim Kelly, a radio personality with FM96 – a station owned by Corus Entertainment which also owns Global News – helped keep plans afloat, hospital staff were doing what they could to give the bride-to-be her best shot at walking down the aisle as scheduled.
“I didn’t know what was going on, but they were washing and braiding my hair to make sure it was not getting matted before the wedding day. And when they put in a central line (for the IV), they made sure to watch where to put it so it wasn’t going to affect my neckline of my dress,” she said.
“Little things like that they really didn’t have to do, but just went the extra mile.”
One nursing staff member even wrote her a letter that was put in an envelope stating not to read until her wedding day.
While she did not divulge the exact contents of the letter, she said it “brought everything full circle” and reminded her of all the support she received.
“I have it framed now. It’s such a special piece.”
It was a particularly unique experience for one LHSC staff member, Kempinska’s sister Anna Kempinska, an emergency department physician at LHSC’s Children’s Hospital.
“Usually when I come in the doors of the hospital, I turn right to go to work,” she said.
“This time I was turning left to go to the resuscitation room to be with Sarah. And I think as a medical professional, you know the worst of the worst, you know what could happen and so it was very unsettling to be so out of control.”
Anna Kempinska helped to explain the complicated medical information to their large, supportive family, adding that as important as the wedding was, her sister’s health was the priority.
“We just wanted Sarah to get better and get her out of the hospital. But, you know, one minute you would sort of be trying to help plan this wedding that Sarah had spent two years planning for. And then the next minute our family would look at each other and say, ‘there’s no way this wedding is going to happen.’”
But with just four days to go before saying “I do,” Kempinska awoke from her coma. At that point, she was using a walker and was exhausted after taking 10 steps on her own.
“The nursing staff were amazing at helping me through that and the physiotherapist as well, but it was all just up in the air. About maybe three days before the wedding, Jim and I were on the phone with the wedding venue talking about alternative dates because we just didn’t know if it was going to happen,” she explained.
“But ultimately, I just remember looking at Jim and saying, ‘I just want to be married to you.’”
Kempinska was released from the hospital on May 30 and married June 3. She required some assistance but was able to walk down the aisle and even dance a little.
In retrospect, LHSC says it’s now believed that the impacts of the disease were worse than first thought when Kempinska’s surgery was conducted, which also occurred after a longer time frame than before due to the pandemic. Additionally, LHSC says that the medications she was on may not have been working as well as they should have.
Going forward, “better medical control will be explored” ahead of future surgeries to lessen the risk of complications, LHSC says.
Kempinska says there is no cure, but she is lucky to have teams of doctors monitoring her situation. She added that she’s just finished another treatment that appears to have gone well and she is “happily married and feeling very good.”
“It’s been kind of a miracle looking back at how it all went down.”

One person has died after the transport truck they were driving fell through a road in southwest Middlesex County on Wednesday night.
Emergency crews were called to Dundonald Road just after 10 p.m. for a reported single vehicle collision.
In a video posted to Twitter Thursday morning, Provincial Const. Jeff Hare said that a transport truck had fallen through the road.
“Unfortunately, the driver succumbed to his injuries at the scene,” he said.
The driver was identified only as a 59-year-old from Mississauga, Ont.
While the investigation is ongoing, Hare noted that the crash came as the region experienced heavy rainfall.
Hare explained that due to “unprecedented storms” that came through the area, “the flooding, according to what some people are saying around here, was monumental.”
Some parts of southwestern Ontario were under various special weather statements and severe thunderstorm warnings on Wednesday as large amounts of rain fell throughout the day.

Chris Traini, county engineer with the County of Middlesex, says there is currently “no indication” that there was “any deficiency of the road,” based on previous road patrol reports.
“There are a number of reasons why the road could wash out and we will have to go in there and determine that,” he said, noting that the county will conduct an internal investigation focusing on the engineering of the road.
The section of road where the washout occurred falls under the county’s jurisdiction. He said road staff follow legislative requirements to inspect the roads on a regular basis.
He also stressed that the county road system is “structurally sound across the board” under typical conditions and even under some extreme conditions.
“I would tell the public that they should have confidence that the road infrastructure in Middlesex County is well maintained, in excellent condition and designed to handle the type of traffic we would expect in an agricultural community, heavy vehicles and transport trucks and passenger vehicles for sure,” he explained.
“But again, when we talk about these extreme weather events, whether it’s, you know, a blizzard, a tornado or an extreme rain event and a flood, drivers need to proceed with caution because we cannot design infrastructure to withstand some of these acts of God or these very extreme weather events.”
Dundonald Road will be closed between Buttonwood Drive and Carolinian Drive for the next couple of weeks as crews work to repair.
“We are experiencing other shut downs as well due to flooding and the roads being washed out,” Hare said. “What we’re asking is that everybody be patient while the roads get replaced and fixed.
“It’s obviously a hard day for everybody involved… Our deepest sympathies and condolences to the family and the first responders that were involved last night,” he added.

Headline: B.C. wildfires: Why some British Columbians say they won’t leave the fire zone

North Shuswap resident Kyle Boppre offers a simple explanation when asked why he defied an evacuation order issued as a wildfire bore down on his neighbourhood.
“It’s just, I guess, in my blood to fight,” he said. “We were able to save our home.”
Boppre and others in the small communities that dot the Shuswap region’s waterfront felt like they were on their own, with no choice but to take the firefight into their own hands.
But authorities say that their actions put their lives at risk and imperil firefighting strategies. Emergency Management Minister Bowinn Ma said Wednesday the unwanted presence of evacuation scofflaws could prevent tactics such as water-bombing or controlled burns.
The 410-square-kilometre Bush Creek East in the Shuswap has resulted in evacuation orders being placed on more than 3,000 properties.
Most evacuation orders have been obeyed, but holdouts like Boppre and others stayed to fight the fires and believe the official response has been inadequate, incompetent, or non-existent.
It’s not just officials who are unimpressed.
Trent Tucker, a professor at Thompson Rivers University, lost his home to the fires near Little Shuswap Lake.
He said it’s entirely irresponsible for people to stay back in evacuation order zones, and he’s “extremely upset” by stories “lionizing” those who have defied evacuation orders.
“Our home is completely gone and yet we have these dummies that stuck around behind and the news is treating them like some sort of heroes,” he said.
“They got lucky it wasn’t like the case in West Kelowna where people stayed back and then they had to get rescued behind fire lines by firefighters.”
Boppre blames authorities.
He said a friend who tried to return to the area to join the fire fight encountered a police roadblock and when he tried to turn around he was chased down, his truck confiscated, and he was not allowed to return to his property in an evacuation zone.
The truck was filled with supplies including food, water, and gasoline, and he was “clearly not a criminal,” Boppre said.
“The government folks, the provincial folks that are trying to quote unquote save our properties,” he added. “Clearly they’re not here.”
Boppre, who runs a marine maintenance and scuba diving business, said members of the community have local knowledge of the geography, but officials from outside don’t seem to value it.
The community bonds are extremely strong among those who’ve stayed behind, Boppre said.
“We can’t wait around for that help that’s supposed to be here and watch our homes burn,” he said. “If I did evacuate when they wanted me to, (I) definitely would have lost my entire livelihood.”
Ma said that she recognized how difficult it is for people to leave their homes, but stressed the importance of following evacuation orders.
“Evacuation orders must be followed. They are not suggestions, they are the law,” she said. “When unauthorized people are in evacuation areas, it escalates the danger involved for everyone.”
Ron Jules, an elder with the Adams Lake Indian Band, lives down river from the community of Chase.
Jules, like Boppre, stayed behind despite an evacuation order and kept a sprinkler going on his roof.
“We can’t evacuate because we have to look after our home,” he said, calling it “all we got.”
Jules said the band had put sprinklers on several community buildings including the school and health centre. He estimated about 70 per cent of the community complied with the evacuation order.
At a Columbia Shuswap Regional District briefing in Salmon Arm, board chairman Kevin Flynn said “it’s inexcusable” that people are staying behind in the evacuation zones and tampering with equipment.
Flynn said there were reports that sprinklers protecting a wooden bridge in the Shuswap area were removed at least three times.
“I just can’t imagine anybody would think that is the right thing to do,” he said. “That is dangerous.”
Forrest Tower with the BC Wildfire Service said Tuesday that the Shuswap area fire quickly turned into an inferno, likely never before witnessed in B.C.
“This is one of, if not the most, significant fire events we have ever witnessed in B.C.,” he said. “We had a fire that went from a 7,000-hectare fire, that went 20 kilometres south in under 12 hours and is now a 41,000-hectare fire. That is a force of nature similar to a tornado, similar to an earthquake or a tsunami.”
Tower urged residents to leave firefighting equipment where it is.
“We have to have that equipment, the pumps, the hoses, the sprinklers, all that has to be there,” he said. “That gear, you might think you are doing something to help yourself, your neighbours, others, but I would really just urge if you could leave it to the professionals. They do have a plan.”

Headline: Millennials set to face most economic pain in months ahead, RBC says. Here’s why

Canadian millennials, particularly those who own a home, are set to face steep interest costs and economic damage in the months ahead, according to a new report from RBC.
Rising interest rates are set to ratchet up the pain on millennials and younger Generation X adults, RBC argues, leaving them especially vulnerable to job losses should the economy slow sharply in the months ahead.
Debt loads are particularly straining on core-age working adults compared with two decades earlier, RBC economist Carrie Freestone argued in the report released Wednesday.
Older millennials, adults aged 35 to 44, had debt-to-disposable income ratios around 250 per cent in 2019, while Freestone noted that metric was roughly 150 per cent for the same age group in 1999.
Younger indebted millennials — those under age 35 — had debt loads worth 165 per cent of their disposable income in 2019. Meanwhile, the country’s youngest cohort hasn’t seen a material rise in debt-to-income ratio since the late ’90s, RBC says, while noting only about one-third of that group has a mortgage.
“The millennial generation has in many ways been defined by its staggeringly high household debt,” Freestone wrote.
The debt situation has only worsened for many Canadians since 2019, as low interest rates during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed many young first-time buyers to enter the hot housing market, saddling owners with mortgages.
Statistics Canada says household debt-to-disposable income rose to 184.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, up from 181.7 per cent last quarter. That means there’s $1.85 in credit market debt for every dollar of household disposable income.
While not every millennial owns their home, those who do are especially vulnerable to the higher interest rate environment, which has seen the Bank of Canada’s policy rate rise 4.75 percentage points from the pandemic-era lows.
RBC expects the average Canadian renewing their mortgage could see their monthly payments jump by 25 per cent by early 2024, based on today’s rates for a typical five-year term.
The problem, Freestone explained, is that incomes haven’t kept pace to absorb the pending mortgage shock. The average hourly income has risen 12 per cent since the start of the pandemic, marking less than half the expected jump in mortgage payments.
The end result? RBC expects that consumption in this middle demographic will take a substantial hit this fall, particularly if millennial and younger Gen X workers are struck by job losses.
“While growth is still holding up even after record rate hikes, higher unemployment rates may trigger an entirely different outcome for demand in the year ahead,” Freestone wrote.
Many economists expect Canada’s economy to slow and the job losses to rise this fall as the lagged impact of higher interest rates starts to bite.
CIBC said in a report released Tuesday that it expects the unemployment rate to creep above 6.0 per cent, up from 5.5 per cent in July, by early 2024. The jobless rate has been rising steadily over the summer, up from near-record lows of 5.0 per cent at the start of the year.
The CIBC report said signs of easing in the labour market this summer should be sufficient to keep the central bank from hiking at its next rate decision on Sept. 6.
If unemployment rises according to its forecast, that could even convince the Bank of Canada to start cutting interest rates as early as the first quarter of 2024, CIBC argued.

Headline: Teen who killed boyfriend in 160 km/h crash sentenced for murder in Ohio

A 19-year-old from Ohio may spend the rest of her life behind bars after she was convicted and sentenced for intentionally crashing her car into a brick wall at 160 km/h (100 mph), killing her boyfriend and a friend.
Mackenzie Shirilla was only 17 years old on the night she crashed her Camry into the side of a commercial building outside Cleveland. Prosecutors argued at her murder trial that the teen had a toxic relationship with her boyfriend, 20-year-old Dominic Russo, and deliberately drove into the brick wall to end their relationship.
In doing so, “she took everybody that was in the car with her,” Tim Troup of the Cuyahoga County prosecutor’s office said. This included Russo’s friend Davion Flanagan, 19.
Both men were pronounced dead at the scene following the wreck. Shirilla was hospitalized.
Shirilla was handed two concurrent life sentences with the possibility of parole after 15 years at her sentencing hearing Monday. Last week, she was found guilty of four counts each of murder and felonious assault, as well as aggravated vehicular homicide and other crimes.
The 19-year-old didn’t testify at her trial, but Shirilla did tearfully read a statement to the families of the victims at her sentencing, saying she couldn’t recall what happened that night in July 2022.
“I hope one day you can see I would never let this happen or do it on purpose,” she said. “I wish I could remember what happened. I’m just so sorry. I’m heartbroken. … I wish I could take all your pain away.”
A video of the final seconds before the deadly crash was showed as evidence during Shirilla’s trial, showing her Camry accelerating down a street before careening into a building, with no signs of slowing down.
Common Pleas Court Judge Nancy Margaret Russo said this video was pivotal in delivering her verdict, calling Shirilla’s actions “controlled, methodical, deliberate, intentional and purposeful.”
“This was not reckless driving. This was murder,” Russo said.
“She morphs from responsible driver to literal hell on wheels,” the judge added, according to Cleveland.com.
Prosecutors argued during the murder trial that Shirilla had made violent threats against her boyfriend in the past, including threatening to break into his home and key his car. On one occasion, two weeks before the wreck, she threatened to crash her car with him in it.
The couple allegedly broke up and fought often, according to witness testimonies.
Meanwhile, defence lawyer James McDonnell said prosecutors had no evidence that Shirilla meant to kill her two passengers or what was going on in the car in the seconds leading up to the crash.
Judge Russo said during Monday’s sentencing hearing that she was sparing the defendant consecutive sentences in the two deaths but didn’t believe Shirilla would get parole in 15 years — and there was “a very good likelihood” Shirilla could spend the rest of her life in prison, depending on her conduct and the parole board’s decision.
