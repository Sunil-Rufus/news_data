Headline: Ukraine claims Crimea landing on Independence Day
Article Content:
Ukraine has claimed its troops briefly landed overnight in the occupied Crimea peninsula, as the country marks 32 years of its independence.
All objectives of the "special operation" were achieved without any casualties, the defence ministry said.
It added that during a firefight in Olenivka and Mayak, western Crimea, "the enemy suffered losses".
Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, eight years before Moscow launched a full-scale invasion.
The Kremlin has so far made no public comments on the reported Ukrainian operation.
In a post on Telegram, the main intelligence department of Ukraine's defence ministry claimed responsibility for Thursday's operation. It said the Ukrainian Navy provided the support.
It said that "special units on watercraft landed on the shore" before engaging in combat with Russian troops stationed in the area.
"Also, the state flag was flying again in the Ukrainian Crimea," the statement added.
The intelligence department posted a short video purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers raising the national flag. Gunfire sounds can be heard in the footage.
Ukraine's Suspilne television channel reported that the skirmish involved aircraft and navy ships. A Russian Telegram channel had also reported of fighting in that area.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released an Independence Day message on X, formerly known as Twitter, rallying his countrymen to help maintain the country's independence.
"In this fight, everyone counts. Because the fight is for something that is important to everyone," Mr Zelensky said.
Independence Day has gained increased significance among Ukrainians since Russia's full-scale invasion started in February 2022, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. It is now the country's third most important holiday, behind only Easter and Christmas.
Ukraine launched its counter-offensive in June, attempting to expel the Russians from land they had captured in the east and south of the country.
An analysis by BBC Verify showed the gains in terms of reclaimed land size have been small.
However, analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) say the advances near Robotyne and Urozhaine are "likely tactically significant because of the structure of Russian defensive lines". They also note that Russian forces have dedicated significant effort to hold the settlements.
Russia has also accused Ukraine of drone attacks, the most recent of which was on 23 August. It hit a skyscraper under construction in Moscow.
Ukraine's claim of landing its troops in Crimea came a day after it emerged that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the mercenary group that fought with Russia in the war, was on the passenger list of a private jet that crashed after taking off from Moscow.
Mr Prigozhin had led a failed mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.

Headline: Who were the Republican debate winners and losers?
Article Content:
This video can not be played
Watch: Candidates reflect on how they did during debate
The first Republican presidential debate was a rowdy affair that saw the eight candidates leap headlong into heated exchanges.
There were some who thought it would be boring without Donald Trump - the ultimate showman - but that was decidedly not the case. The former president may have been the life of the party during primary debates back in 2016, but the eight rivals who travelled to Wisconsin proved they could bring some excitement without his help.
Some candidates stood out from the pack, however - and some seemed to languish on the side-lines.
Here's a rundown of the winners and losers.
Vivek Ramaswamy: The man who never ran for public office - and didn't even vote for a president from 2004 to 2020 - simply dominated this Republican debate.
With a broad smile and a quick tongue, he frequently seemed to be the only candidate on the stage who was enjoying himself. That may partly be because this political novice has exceeded expectations, and is essentially playing with house money while he takes centre stage.
He easily fended off swipes from his fellow candidates, suggesting that Mr Christie was auditioning for a show on left-leaning news channel MSNBC and that Ms Haley was angling for spots on the board of defence contractors with her positions on Ukraine.
"I'm the only person on the stage who isn't bought and paid for," he said during a discussion of climate change - prompting cries of outrage from his rivals.
This video can not be played
Ramaswamy: 'I was clearly the winner of this thing'
Time and time again, Mr Ramaswamy positioned himself as the outsider against a bunch of political establishment insiders. Many of his views - calling on Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, using military force to secure the US-Mexico border, and banning US companies from doing business with China - are well outside the political mainstream even within the Republican Party. But as Mr Trump demonstrated in 2016, even outlandish, impractical policy proposals can be effective in generating attention.
Mr Ramaswamy may not have the political fuel to challenge Mr Trump for the nomination, and he may not even want to, but the evening's debate ensures that he's going to continue to be a factor in this race in the months ahead.
Mike Pence: The veteran politician, who has served as a congressman, a governor and a vice-president, has a bit of fight left in him.
Although his presidential campaign has been sputtering - hated by Trump supporters and distrusted by Trump critics - his debate-stage experience served him well on Wednesday night.
He went on the attack early, swiping at Mr Ramaswamy's inexperience, saying, "Now is not the time for on-the-job training".
He offered a passionate, religion-based call for nationwide abortion limits. That likely won't play well in next year's general election. But it could help him win over evangelical Republicans, who can tilt the balance in states like Iowa and South Carolina, which play an outsized role in deciding the party nominee.
During the second-half of the debate, when discussion of Mr Trump came up, Mr Pence had the last word, saying he put the Constitution first on January 6, 2021 when he refused to throw out the election results at Mr Trump's behest. Several of his rivals even spoke out in his favour.
The fundamental challenges to Mr Pence's campaign remain, but for at least one night he showed why he was once considered by many conservative Republicans to be presidential material.
Nikki Haley: The former US ambassador to the UN has made a habit of surprising those who underestimate her. She has never lost a race for office, even when she was challenging more established Republican candidates for the South Carolina governorship.
On Wednesday night, she stood out by offering sharp criticism early of both Mr Trump and the Republican Party as a whole.
"Republicans did this to you too," she said when describing the massive US budget deficit. "They need to stop the spending, stop the borrowing."
When the topic turned to the former president, she said Mr Trump was the "most disliked politician in America" - and warned the Republican Party will suffer because of it in the general election.
She also showed will for the fight. She scrapped with Mr Ramaswamy on continuing US aid to Ukraine, which she supports. And she clashed with Mr Pence on abortion, calling his demands for a national abortion ban unrealistic and politically damaging.
Even if she can't pull ahead in the pack this time around, her debate performance could position the 51-year-old for future presidential bids in election years not dominated by a former president.
Tim Scott and Chris Christie: Mr Christie did exactly what many expected him to. He took swipes at Mr Trump, had some choice lines targeting Mr Ramaswamy, and was generally feisty and combative.
He was also roundly booed when he was introduced, when he criticised Mr Trump, and when he took big swings at Mr Ramaswamy.
His choicest line came when he said the political neophyte "sounds like ChatGPT" - but that particular twist did nothing to ingratiate him with the crowd.
As for Tim Scott, his nice-guy attitude meant he frequently stayed above the fray during the most heated debate moments. That won't help him win over many voters, but it could burnish his credentials if he wants to be Mr Trump's vice-presidential pick.
Ron DeSantis: At the beginning of the year, the race for the Republican nomination seemed like it would be a two-man contest between Mr DeSantis and Mr Trump. Since then, the Florida governor has sagged in the polls.
If the rest of the Republican pack hasn't caught up to him yet, it may very well have him after this debate.
It wasn't a terrible performance - he had his moments, particularly when he spoke about his record of military service and his calls for more aggressive government policies to deal with the opioid epidemic.
He was on the side-lines for all the key moments of the debate, however. Mr Ramaswamy ran circles around him. Other candidates, like Mr Pence and Ms Haley, elbowed him out of the way on issues like abortion and US aid to Ukraine. He seemed on uneven footing when the topic turned to Mr Trump and his recent indictments.
This was not the kind of performance needed to close the gap with Mr Trump. The man who was once billed as the future of the Republican Party was simply a non-factor.
Asa Hutchinson and Doug Burgum: Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson was the last candidate to qualify for the Milwaukee debate. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum paid his way onto the stage with a gimmick - offering enough people $20 gift cards if they donated $1 to his campaign.
Both candidates desperately needed to show that they deserved to be there, and both were mostly afterthoughts.
Mr Hutchinson's criticisms of Mr Trump seemed weak sauce compared to Mr Christie's more pointed attacks. And Mr Burgum's awe-shucks small-state conservatism never really stood out.
The qualification standards become more rigorous for next month's primary debate in California, and neither candidate did enough on Wednesday night to build the kind of support they will need to make another appearances on the debate stage likely.

Headline: China retaliates as Japan releases Fukushima water
Article Content:
Japan has begun its controversial discharge of treated waste water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean, sparking protests in the region and retaliation from Beijing.
China is the biggest buyer of seafood from Japan, and on Thursday it said it would block all such imports.
Japan says the water is safe, and many scientists agree. The UN's nuclear watchdog has also approved the plan.
But critics say more studies need to be done and the release should be halted.
More than a million tonnes of water stored at the nuclear plant will be discharged over the next 30 years.
China, which has been the most vocal of opponents since the plan was announced two years ago, called the water discharge an "extremely selfish and irresponsible act" and said Japan was "passing an open wound onto the future generations of humanity".
Shortly afterwards, China's customs office announced that an existing ban on seafood imports from Fukushima and some prefectures would be immediately extended to cover the whole of Japan to "protect the health of Chinese consumers".
The move is calculated to inflict economic damage, and Japan has admitted that businesses will take a "significant" hit. Mainland China and Hong Kong together import more than $1.1bn (Â£866m) of seafood from Japan every year - making up nearly half of Japan's seafood exports.
But analysts say that the reactions from China in particular, are as much motivated by politics as they are by genuine concerns.
Tokyo's relationship to Beijing has deteriorated in recent years as it draws closer to the US and also shows support to Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by China.
"This incident is more of a symptom than a cause of worsening Sino-Japanese relations," said Chinese foreign policy expert Neil Thomas with the Asia Society Policy Institute.
"Beijing may have made less of a fuss about the water release if its relationship with Tokyo was in a better place."
In return, Japan is likely to "reject this criticism, but they are unlikely to do anything provocative," said James DJ Brown, a professor specialising in Japanese foreign policy at Temple University's Japan campus.
"While Japan's government is deeply concerned by what it sees as the aggressive actions of the Chinese Communist Party, they understand that it is in their interests to maintain stable relations with their larger neighbour."
But it may not need to wait for long. Some observers believe that China may not stick with the ban.
"China's growing economic difficulties could mean that any ban is relatively brief and narrow, so as to limit the negative impact on Chinese importers and business sentiment," said Mr Thomas.
South Korea also has a longstanding ban on some Japanese seafood. But on Thursday its government had a more muted reaction.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said "what is important now is whether Japan, as it promised to the international community, strictly follows the scientific standards and transparently provides information".
Seoul and Tokyo have drawn closer despite deep historical grievances, united in their allyship to the US while facing down threats from North Korea and China.
However, most South Koreans are opposed to the water's release, and on Thursday protesters in Seoul attempted to storm the Japanese embassy. Angry demonstrations were also held in Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Meanwhile Mark Brown, chair of the Pacific Islands Forum which had previously castigated the plan, said they now believe the plan "meets international safety standards".
Since a tsunami destroyed the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, power plant company Tepco has been pumping in water to cool down the reactors' fuel rods. This means every day the plant produces contaminated water, which is treated and stored in massive tanks.
Even after treatment, the water contains unacceptably high levels of radioactive substances tritium and carbon-14 which are difficult to remove. Japan's solution is to dilute it with seawater before releasing it into the ocean.
More than 1,000 tanks have been filled, and Japan says this is not a sustainable long-term solution. It has argued that after treatment and dilution the water is safe to release.
Many scientists have backed the plan, saying it is sound. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has also said the plan complies with international standards and would have a "negligible" impact on the environment.
Authorities have promised to continuously monitor levels of radiation in the ocean and to maintain a high level of transparency.
But there are some who are still sceptical given Tepco's track record - the company has in the past been blamed for a lack of transparency over the disaster, which it has apologised for.
And while disposing treated water in the ocean is common practice for nuclear plants, critics have pointed out that the amount being released from Fukushima is on an unprecedented, far vaster scale.
Some scientists say more studies should be done on how it would affect the ocean bed and marine life. Environmental activist group Greenpeace has also called for the water to stay in the tanks until better processing technology is invented.
The plan has particularly angered coastal communities and fishermen in Japan. They fear it would harm their livelihoods as some worried consumers avoid seafood from the area, which has never fully recovered economically since the 2011 disaster.
The wider Japanese public also remains deeply divided on the issue, with only half supporting the water's discharge according to the latest polls.
"I think there should have been many other methods... instead of releasing it into the ocean," Tokyo protester Keiko Kisei told Reuters on Thursday.
"However, they chose to discharge the water and cause trouble to the world. It's absolutely unacceptable."

Headline: Thousands of penguins die in Antarctic ice breakup
Article Content:
A catastrophic die-off of emperor penguin chicks has been observed in the Antarctic, with up to 10,000 young birds estimated to have been killed.
The sea-ice underneath the chicks melted and broke apart before they could develop the waterproof feathers needed to swim in the ocean.
The birds most likely drowned or froze to death.
The event, in late 2022, occurred in the west of the continent in an area fronting on to the Bellingshausen Sea.
It was recorded by satellites.
Dr Peter Fretwell, from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), said the wipeout was a harbinger of things to come.
More than 90% of emperor penguin colonies are predicted to be all but extinct by the end of the century, as the continent's seasonal sea-ice withers in an ever-warming world.
"Emperors depend on sea-ice for their breeding cycle; it's the stable platform they use to bring up their young. But if that ice is not as extensive as it should be or breaks up faster, these birds are in trouble," he told BBC News.
"There is hope: we can cut our carbon emissions that are causing the warming. But if we don't we will drive these iconic, beautiful birds to the verge of extinction."
Dr Fretwell and colleagues report the die-off in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.
The scientists tracked five colonies in the Bellingshausen Sea sector - at Rothschild Island, Verdi Inlet, Smyley Island, Bryan Peninsula and Pfrogner Point.
Using the EU's Sentinel-2 satellites, they were able to observe the penguins' activity from the excrement, or guano, they left on the white sea-ice.
This brown staining is visible even from space.
Adult birds jump out on to the sea-ice around March as the Southern Hemisphere winter approaches. They court, copulate, lay eggs, brood those eggs, and then feed their nestlings through the following months until it's time for the young to make their own way in the world.
This normally occurs around December/January time, when the new birds head out into the ocean.
But the research team watched as sea-ice under emperor rookeries fragmented in November, before thousands of chicks had had time to fledge the slick feathers needed for swimming.
Four of the colonies suffered total breeding failure as a result. Only the most northerly site, at Rothschild Island, had some success.
Antarctic summer sea-ice has been on a sharp downturn since 2016, with the total area of frozen water around the continent diminishing to new record lows.
The two absolute lowest years have occurred in the past two summer seasons, in 2021/22 and in 2022/23, when the Bellingshausen was almost completely devoid of ice cover.
What is more, the slowness of floes to form in recent months means the colonies will probably not be producing chicks for at least another year.
Winter maximum sea-ice extent, normally reached in September, will track far below where it would normally be.
Dr Fretwell and colleagues said the emperors were feeling the impacts of this shift in conditions. Between 2018 and 2022, roughly a third of the more than 60 known emperor penguin colonies were affected in some way by diminished sea-ice extent - whether that's ice forming later in the season or breaking up earlier.
At the other end of the planet, in the Arctic, the sea-ice has been in a decades-long, steady decline. The Antarctic in contrast seemed more robust. Up until 2016, it was becoming slightly more extensive year on year.
BAS colleague Dr Caroline Holmes is an expert on Antarctic sea-ice. She links the causes for the current decline to anomalously warm ocean water around the continent and a particular pattern of winds, which in the case of the Bellingshausen, has pushed ice back towards the coast, making it difficult to spread.
These were remarkable times, she said.
"What we're seeing right now is so far outside what we've observed previously. We expected change but I don't think we expected so much change so rapidly," she told BBC News.
"Studies in the Arctic have suggested that if we could reverse climate warming somehow, the sea-ice in the polar north would recover. Whether that might also apply in the Antarctic, we don't know. But there's every reason to think that if it got cold enough, the sea-ice would reform."
Currently, emperors are classified as "Near Threatened" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the organisation that keeps the lists of Earth's most endangered animals.
A proposal has been made to lift emperors into the more urgent "Vulnerable" category because of the danger posed by climate warming to their way of life.

Many scientists have backed the plan, saying it is sound. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has also said the plan complies with international standards and would have a "negligible" impact on the environment.
Authorities have promised to continuously monitor levels of radiation in the ocean and to maintain a high level of transparency.
But there are some who are still sceptical given Tepco's track record - the company has in the past been blamed for a lack of transparency over the disaster, which it has apologised for.
And while disposing treated water in the ocean is common practice for nuclear plants, critics have pointed out that the amount being released from Fukushima is on an unprecedented, far vaster scale.
Some scientists say more studies should be done on how it would affect the ocean bed and marine life. Environmental activist group Greenpeace has also called for the water to stay in the tanks until better processing technology is invented.
The plan has particularly angered coastal communities and fishermen in Japan. They fear it would harm their livelihoods as some worried consumers avoid seafood from the area, which has never fully recovered economically since the 2011 disaster.
The wider Japanese public also remains deeply divided on the issue, with only half supporting the water's discharge according to the latest polls.
"I think there should have been many other methods... instead of releasing it into the ocean," Tokyo protester Keiko Kisei told Reuters on Thursday.
"However, they chose to discharge the water and cause trouble to the world. It's absolutely unacceptable."

Headline: Thousands of penguins die in Antarctic ice breakup
Article Content:
A catastrophic die-off of emperor penguin chicks has been observed in the Antarctic, with up to 10,000 young birds estimated to have been killed.
The sea-ice underneath the chicks melted and broke apart before they could develop the waterproof feathers needed to swim in the ocean.
The birds most likely drowned or froze to death.
The event, in late 2022, occurred in the west of the continent in an area fronting on to the Bellingshausen Sea.
It was recorded by satellites.
Dr Peter Fretwell, from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), said the wipeout was a harbinger of things to come.
More than 90% of emperor penguin colonies are predicted to be all but extinct by the end of the century, as the continent's seasonal sea-ice withers in an ever-warming world.
"Emperors depend on sea-ice for their breeding cycle; it's the stable platform they use to bring up their young. But if that ice is not as extensive as it should be or breaks up faster, these birds are in trouble," he told BBC News.
"There is hope: we can cut our carbon emissions that are causing the warming. But if we don't we will drive these iconic, beautiful birds to the verge of extinction."
Dr Fretwell and colleagues report the die-off in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.
The scientists tracked five colonies in the Bellingshausen Sea sector - at Rothschild Island, Verdi Inlet, Smyley Island, Bryan Peninsula and Pfrogner Point.
Using the EU's Sentinel-2 satellites, they were able to observe the penguins' activity from the excrement, or guano, they left on the white sea-ice.
This brown staining is visible even from space.
Adult birds jump out on to the sea-ice around March as the Southern Hemisphere winter approaches. They court, copulate, lay eggs, brood those eggs, and then feed their nestlings through the following months until it's time for the young to make their own way in the world.
This normally occurs around December/January time, when the new birds head out into the ocean.
But the research team watched as sea-ice under emperor rookeries fragmented in November, before thousands of chicks had had time to fledge the slick feathers needed for swimming.
Four of the colonies suffered total breeding failure as a result. Only the most northerly site, at Rothschild Island, had some success.
Antarctic summer sea-ice has been on a sharp downturn since 2016, with the total area of frozen water around the continent diminishing to new record lows.
The two absolute lowest years have occurred in the past two summer seasons, in 2021/22 and in 2022/23, when the Bellingshausen was almost completely devoid of ice cover.
What is more, the slowness of floes to form in recent months means the colonies will probably not be producing chicks for at least another year.
Winter maximum sea-ice extent, normally reached in September, will track far below where it would normally be.
Dr Fretwell and colleagues said the emperors were feeling the impacts of this shift in conditions. Between 2018 and 2022, roughly a third of the more than 60 known emperor penguin colonies were affected in some way by diminished sea-ice extent - whether that's ice forming later in the season or breaking up earlier.
At the other end of the planet, in the Arctic, the sea-ice has been in a decades-long, steady decline. The Antarctic in contrast seemed more robust. Up until 2016, it was becoming slightly more extensive year on year.
BAS colleague Dr Caroline Holmes is an expert on Antarctic sea-ice. She links the causes for the current decline to anomalously warm ocean water around the continent and a particular pattern of winds, which in the case of the Bellingshausen, has pushed ice back towards the coast, making it difficult to spread.
These were remarkable times, she said.
"What we're seeing right now is so far outside what we've observed previously. We expected change but I don't think we expected so much change so rapidly," she told BBC News.
"Studies in the Arctic have suggested that if we could reverse climate warming somehow, the sea-ice in the polar north would recover. Whether that might also apply in the Antarctic, we don't know. But there's every reason to think that if it got cold enough, the sea-ice would reform."
Currently, emperors are classified as "Near Threatened" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the organisation that keeps the lists of Earth's most endangered animals.
A proposal has been made to lift emperors into the more urgent "Vulnerable" category because of the danger posed by climate warming to their way of life.

Headline: Ukraine claims Crimea landing on Independence Day
Article Content:
Ukraine has claimed its troops briefly landed overnight in the occupied Crimea peninsula, as the country marks 32 years of its independence.
All objectives of the "special operation" were achieved without any casualties, the defence ministry said.
It added that during a firefight in Olenivka and Mayak, western Crimea, "the enemy suffered losses".
Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, eight years before Moscow launched a full-scale invasion.
The Kremlin has so far made no public comments on the reported Ukrainian operation.
In a post on Telegram, the main intelligence department of Ukraine's defence ministry claimed responsibility for Thursday's operation. It said the Ukrainian Navy provided the support.
It said that "special units on watercraft landed on the shore" before engaging in combat with Russian troops stationed in the area.
"Also, the state flag was flying again in the Ukrainian Crimea," the statement added.
The intelligence department posted a short video purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers raising the national flag. Gunfire sounds can be heard in the footage.
Ukraine's Suspilne television channel reported that the skirmish involved aircraft and navy ships. A Russian Telegram channel had also reported of fighting in that area.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released an Independence Day message on X, formerly known as Twitter, rallying his countrymen to help maintain the country's independence.
"In this fight, everyone counts. Because the fight is for something that is important to everyone," Mr Zelensky said.
Independence Day has gained increased significance among Ukrainians since Russia's full-scale invasion started in February 2022, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. It is now the country's third most important holiday, behind only Easter and Christmas.
Ukraine launched its counter-offensive in June, attempting to expel the Russians from land they had captured in the east and south of the country.
An analysis by BBC Verify showed the gains in terms of reclaimed land size have been small.
However, analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) say the advances near Robotyne and Urozhaine are "likely tactically significant because of the structure of Russian defensive lines". They also note that Russian forces have dedicated significant effort to hold the settlements.
Russia has also accused Ukraine of drone attacks, the most recent of which was on 23 August. It hit a skyscraper under construction in Moscow.
Ukraine's claim of landing its troops in Crimea came a day after it emerged that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the mercenary group that fought with Russia in the war, was on the passenger list of a private jet that crashed after taking off from Moscow.
Mr Prigozhin had led a failed mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.

Headline: Who were the Republican debate winners and losers?
Article Content:
This video can not be played
Watch: Candidates reflect on how they did during debate
The first Republican presidential debate was a rowdy affair that saw the eight candidates leap headlong into heated exchanges.
There were some who thought it would be boring without Donald Trump - the ultimate showman - but that was decidedly not the case. The former president may have been the life of the party during primary debates back in 2016, but the eight rivals who travelled to Wisconsin proved they could bring some excitement without his help.
Some candidates stood out from the pack, however - and some seemed to languish on the side-lines.
Here's a rundown of the winners and losers.
Vivek Ramaswamy: The man who never ran for public office - and didn't even vote for a president from 2004 to 2020 - simply dominated this Republican debate.
With a broad smile and a quick tongue, he frequently seemed to be the only candidate on the stage who was enjoying himself. That may partly be because this political novice has exceeded expectations, and is essentially playing with house money while he takes centre stage.
He easily fended off swipes from his fellow candidates, suggesting that Mr Christie was auditioning for a show on left-leaning news channel MSNBC and that Ms Haley was angling for spots on the board of defence contractors with her positions on Ukraine.
"I'm the only person on the stage who isn't bought and paid for," he said during a discussion of climate change - prompting cries of outrage from his rivals.
This video can not be played
Ramaswamy: 'I was clearly the winner of this thing'
Time and time again, Mr Ramaswamy positioned himself as the outsider against a bunch of political establishment insiders. Many of his views - calling on Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, using military force to secure the US-Mexico border, and banning US companies from doing business with China - are well outside the political mainstream even within the Republican Party. But as Mr Trump demonstrated in 2016, even outlandish, impractical policy proposals can be effective in generating attention.
Mr Ramaswamy may not have the political fuel to challenge Mr Trump for the nomination, and he may not even want to, but the evening's debate ensures that he's going to continue to be a factor in this race in the months ahead.
Mike Pence: The veteran politician, who has served as a congressman, a governor and a vice-president, has a bit of fight left in him.
Although his presidential campaign has been sputtering - hated by Trump supporters and distrusted by Trump critics - his debate-stage experience served him well on Wednesday night.
He went on the attack early, swiping at Mr Ramaswamy's inexperience, saying, "Now is not the time for on-the-job training".
He offered a passionate, religion-based call for nationwide abortion limits. That likely won't play well in next year's general election. But it could help him win over evangelical Republicans, who can tilt the balance in states like Iowa and South Carolina, which play an outsized role in deciding the party nominee.
During the second-half of the debate, when discussion of Mr Trump came up, Mr Pence had the last word, saying he put the Constitution first on January 6, 2021 when he refused to throw out the election results at Mr Trump's behest. Several of his rivals even spoke out in his favour.
The fundamental challenges to Mr Pence's campaign remain, but for at least one night he showed why he was once considered by many conservative Republicans to be presidential material.
Nikki Haley: The former US ambassador to the UN has made a habit of surprising those who underestimate her. She has never lost a race for office, even when she was challenging more established Republican candidates for the South Carolina governorship.
On Wednesday night, she stood out by offering sharp criticism early of both Mr Trump and the Republican Party as a whole.
"Republicans did this to you too," she said when describing the massive US budget deficit. "They need to stop the spending, stop the borrowing."
When the topic turned to the former president, she said Mr Trump was the "most disliked politician in America" - and warned the Republican Party will suffer because of it in the general election.
She also showed will for the fight. She scrapped with Mr Ramaswamy on continuing US aid to Ukraine, which she supports. And she clashed with Mr Pence on abortion, calling his demands for a national abortion ban unrealistic and politically damaging.
Even if she can't pull ahead in the pack this time around, her debate performance could position the 51-year-old for future presidential bids in election years not dominated by a former president.
Tim Scott and Chris Christie: Mr Christie did exactly what many expected him to. He took swipes at Mr Trump, had some choice lines targeting Mr Ramaswamy, and was generally feisty and combative.
He was also roundly booed when he was introduced, when he criticised Mr Trump, and when he took big swings at Mr Ramaswamy.
His choicest line came when he said the political neophyte "sounds like ChatGPT" - but that particular twist did nothing to ingratiate him with the crowd.
As for Tim Scott, his nice-guy attitude meant he frequently stayed above the fray during the most heated debate moments. That won't help him win over many voters, but it could burnish his credentials if he wants to be Mr Trump's vice-presidential pick.
Ron DeSantis: At the beginning of the year, the race for the Republican nomination seemed like it would be a two-man contest between Mr DeSantis and Mr Trump. Since then, the Florida governor has sagged in the polls.
If the rest of the Republican pack hasn't caught up to him yet, it may very well have him after this debate.
It wasn't a terrible performance - he had his moments, particularly when he spoke about his record of military service and his calls for more aggressive government policies to deal with the opioid epidemic.
He was on the side-lines for all the key moments of the debate, however. Mr Ramaswamy ran circles around him. Other candidates, like Mr Pence and Ms Haley, elbowed him out of the way on issues like abortion and US aid to Ukraine. He seemed on uneven footing when the topic turned to Mr Trump and his recent indictments.
This was not the kind of performance needed to close the gap with Mr Trump. The man who was once billed as the future of the Republican Party was simply a non-factor.
Asa Hutchinson and Doug Burgum: Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson was the last candidate to qualify for the Milwaukee debate. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum paid his way onto the stage with a gimmick - offering enough people $20 gift cards if they donated $1 to his campaign.
Both candidates desperately needed to show that they deserved to be there, and both were mostly afterthoughts.
Mr Hutchinson's criticisms of Mr Trump seemed weak sauce compared to Mr Christie's more pointed attacks. And Mr Burgum's awe-shucks small-state conservatism never really stood out.
The qualification standards become more rigorous for next month's primary debate in California, and neither candidate did enough on Wednesday night to build the kind of support they will need to make another appearances on the debate stage likely.

Headline: China retaliates as Japan releases Fukushima water
Article Content:
Japan has begun its controversial discharge of treated waste water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean, sparking protests in the region and retaliation from Beijing.
China is the biggest buyer of seafood from Japan, and on Thursday it said it would block all such imports.
Japan says the water is safe, and many scientists agree. The UN's nuclear watchdog has also approved the plan.
But critics say more studies need to be done and the release should be halted.
More than a million tonnes of water stored at the nuclear plant will be discharged over the next 30 years.
China, which has been the most vocal of opponents since the plan was announced two years ago, called the water discharge an "extremely selfish and irresponsible act" and said Japan was "passing an open wound onto the future generations of humanity".
Shortly afterwards, China's customs office announced that an existing ban on seafood imports from Fukushima and some prefectures would be immediately extended to cover the whole of Japan to "protect the health of Chinese consumers".
The move is calculated to inflict economic damage, and Japan has admitted that businesses will take a "significant" hit. Mainland China and Hong Kong together import more than $1.1bn (Â£866m) of seafood from Japan every year - making up nearly half of Japan's seafood exports.
But analysts say that the reactions from China in particular, are as much motivated by politics as they are by genuine concerns.
Tokyo's relationship to Beijing has deteriorated in recent years as it draws closer to the US and also shows support to Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by China.
"This incident is more of a symptom than a cause of worsening Sino-Japanese relations," said Chinese foreign policy expert Neil Thomas with the Asia Society Policy Institute.
"Beijing may have made less of a fuss about the water release if its relationship with Tokyo was in a better place."
In return, Japan is likely to "reject this criticism, but they are unlikely to do anything provocative," said James DJ Brown, a professor specialising in Japanese foreign policy at Temple University's Japan campus.
"While Japan's government is deeply concerned by what it sees as the aggressive actions of the Chinese Communist Party, they understand that it is in their interests to maintain stable relations with their larger neighbour."
But it may not need to wait for long. Some observers believe that China may not stick with the ban.
"China's growing economic difficulties could mean that any ban is relatively brief and narrow, so as to limit the negative impact on Chinese importers and business sentiment," said Mr Thomas.
South Korea also has a longstanding ban on some Japanese seafood. But on Thursday its government had a more muted reaction.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said "what is important now is whether Japan, as it promised to the international community, strictly follows the scientific standards and transparently provides information".
Seoul and Tokyo have drawn closer despite deep historical grievances, united in their allyship to the US while facing down threats from North Korea and China.
However, most South Koreans are opposed to the water's release, and on Thursday protesters in Seoul attempted to storm the Japanese embassy. Angry demonstrations were also held in Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Meanwhile Mark Brown, chair of the Pacific Islands Forum which had previously castigated the plan, said they now believe the plan "meets international safety standards".
Since a tsunami destroyed the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, power plant company Tepco has been pumping in water to cool down the reactors' fuel rods. This means every day the plant produces contaminated water, which is treated and stored in massive tanks.
Even after treatment, the water contains unacceptably high levels of radioactive substances tritium and carbon-14 which are difficult to remove. Japan's solution is to dilute it with seawater before releasing it into the ocean.
More than 1,000 tanks have been filled, and Japan says this is not a sustainable long-term solution. It has argued that after treatment and dilution the water is safe to release.
Many scientists have backed the plan, saying it is sound. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has also said the plan complies with international standards and would have a "negligible" impact on the environment.
Authorities have promised to continuously monitor levels of radiation in the ocean and to maintain a high level of transparency.

"I think there should have been many other methods... instead of releasing it into the ocean," Tokyo protester Keiko Kisei told Reuters on Thursday.
"However, they chose to discharge the water and cause trouble to the world. It's absolutely unacceptable."

Headline: Rosenberg: Wagner defied Putin, now its leader may be dead
Article Content:
This video can not be played
Watch: Yevgeny Prigozhin and the war in Ukraine
When Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner troops launched their insurrection two months ago, Vladimir Putin made his feelings more than clear. He called it "treachery" and a "stab in the back" of Russia. He promised that the perpetrators would be punished.
So there was incredulity in Russia when they were not. When a deal was cut between Mr Prigozhin and the Kremlin to end the mutiny; when all the charges against the Wagner founder and his fighters were dropped, despite the fact that Russian servicemen had been killed during the murky but brief insurrection.
It made President Putin look weak.
Commenting on the agreed compromise (ending the mutiny in exchange for immunity from prosecution) one Russian newspaper commented: "This kind of compromise is normally made with political opponents. Never with criminals and terrorists. Does that mean we should view Mr Prigozhin now as a political figure?"
Suddenly things look rather different.
Exactly two months on, Mr Prigozhin is presumed dead after his private jet crashed and exploded in a field. Wagner commander Dmitry Utkin was on the same jet.
The Russian elite will shed few tears over Mr Prigozhin's reported demise. That goes for Russia's military leadership, whom Mr Prigozhin had publicly and vocally condemned and whom he demanded be sacked. The Wagner boss claimed that the so-called "March of Justice" (his euphemism for the insurrection) had not targeted the Kremlin but had instead been directed at Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov.
In reality, the Wagner mutiny had been a direct challenge to President Putin's authority and a humiliating 24 hours for the Kremlin. Mr Putin himself pointed out that the Russian state had been financing Wagner. Money had clearly not bought loyalty.
If this was an act of revenge by those in power, that sends two clear messages to Mr Prigozhin's loyalists and to anyone else in Russia who may have been contemplating armed resistance:
That means that President Putin could emerge from these dramatic events stronger domestically.
But what if Mr Prigozhin becomes a martyr? What if those who had pledged loyalty to him - and who are well-trained fighters - call for their own acts of revenge?
Grey Zone, a Telegram channel linked to Wagner, blamed Mr Prigozhin's reported death on "Russian traitors".
It did not clarify who it believed those traitors were and what Wagner's response would be.
If this crash was foul play, that will come as little surprise to many in Russia. Ever since the mutiny there has been feverish speculation about Mr Prigozhin's fate, about whether his actions really would be forgiven.
He must have known that. Yet, in recent weeks, as he jetted around on his private plane he clearly did not view air travel as a danger. Perhaps he believed that he was too powerful, too crucial a figure in today's Russia to be taken out?

Headline: How Russia reacted after Prigozhin plane crash
Article Content:
This video can not be played
Watch: Prigozhin, from hot dog seller to mercenary group leader
Russia is a country full of surprises.
People here were shocked this summer after drones attacked the centre of Moscow on several occasions, causing explosions and damage to buildings.
Then, the Russian rouble took an unexpected tumble - briefly tipping the dollar rate to over 100 roubles.
Add to that, a failed mission to the Moon: Russia's 'Luna-25' lander was lost in space, destroyed as it collided with the lunar surface last week.
But today, as the news broke that Yevgeny Prigozhin's plane had fallen out of the sky, crashing in a fireball in Russia's Tver Region, most people were far from shocked. In fact, most Russians were probably surprised it hadn't happened sooner.
Speculation had been swirling for weeks in Russia about exactly what fate awaited Yevgeny Prigozhin. Exactly two months ago, the Wagner boss launched his brief mutiny.
His mercenaries seized a major Russian city and even marched on Moscow. After the rebellion was called off, many thought Prigozhin's days were numbered. After all, the mutiny was a significant humiliation for the Kremlin, and President Putin isn't the kind of man to forgive and forget.
About an hour after the crash, the Russian Federal Aviation Agency Rosaviatsiya released a statement confirming that Yevgeny Prigozhin's name was on the passenger manifest.
That is unusually quick for Rosaviatsiya: the agency is usually much slower to respond to such incidents. That raised eyebrows here.
Russian state TV is keeping reporting of the incident to a minimum, quoting government officials with no comment. In its main evening news bulletin, Kremlin-controlled Channel One dedicated just 30 seconds to the story.
It is a well-known fact in Russia that state TV channels often wait until they receive official instructions regarding the tone of reporting.
As for the Wagner group itself, Telegram channels linked to the mercenaries have claimed that Prigozhin "was killedâ¦.by traitors of Russia". At the Wagner HQ in the city of St Petersburg, a makeshift shrine has appeared. Images on Russian media show people bringing flowers and candles to the Wagner Centre.
Attention is now turning to what happened on board the flight. According to Russian media, investigators are looking into a number of possible causes, including "external actions".
Commenting on the incident, political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said that the cause of the plane crash is not important - more significant is the message it sends to any other potential mutineers: "Everyone will see this as an act of retaliation and retributionâ¦From Putin's perspective, as well as many among the security and military officials, Prigozhin's death should serve as a lesson."

Headline: Two killings in three days in small French city
Article Content:
An 18-year-old has been shot dead in the southern French city of NÃ®mes, days after a boy aged 10 was killed by gunfire in an attack linked to the drugs trade.
Both shootings took place in the Pissevin area of the city which has become plagued by drug violence.
The first victim, called Fayed, was fatally shot on Monday night while he was in a car with his uncle.
In the latest attack. the teenage victim was ambushed a few streets away.
Local prosecutor CÃ©cile Gensac said it was the 10-year-old's misfortune to be "in the wrong place at the wrong time" shortly before midnight on Monday.
Fayed was shot just 100m from his home in Pissevin. His family had no connection with drug gangs and had never had any brush with authority, the prosecutor said.
Police believe the uncle's Renault Clio car had been wrongly linked by the killers to another shooting and Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin spoke of a "tit-for-tat attack between drug dealers".
NÃ®mes Mayor Jean-Paul Fournier said he was saddened and revolted by the boy's death and police sent an elite CRS8 team to beef up security.
The CR8 have already been deployed 100km (60 miles) to the south in Marseille, where drug turf wars have claimed a dozen lives in little more than a month.
Two rival gangs, Yoda and DZ Mafia, are said to be behind most of the shootings in northern areas of the Mediterranean port city, particularly in the high-rise district of La Paternelle.
Smaller regional cities such as NÃ®mes are now becoming caught up in the drugs war.
Despite the deployment of about 20 elite police, the second shooting there this week took place in the early hours of Thursday. Authorities said it unfolded during a drug deal and the 18-year-old victim was known to police.
The local prosecutor said bullet casings were found at the scene and the murder was being linked to organised crime.
French reports said the teenager had been carrying a satchel containing â¬5 and â¬10 notes when his attackers opened fire, apparently with a assault-type rifle and a handgun.
A young student tried in vain to resuscitate him. The satchel with the cash was found by his side.

Headline: India's lunar rover takes a walk on the Moon
Article Content:
India's Moon rover has taken first steps on the lunar surface a day after the country made history by becoming the first to land near the south pole.
Chandrayaan-3's rover "ramped down" from the lander and "India took a walk on the Moon!", the space agency said.
The Vikram lander successfully touched down as planned on Wednesday evening.
With this, India joins an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.
The 26kg rover called Pragyaan (the Sanskrit word for wisdom) was carried to the Moon in the Vikram lander's belly.
After the dust raised by last evening's landing had settled, panels on one side of Vikram opened to deploy a ramp to enable Pragyaan to slide down to the lunar surface.
It will now roam around the rocks and craters, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.
Pragyaan is carrying two scientific instruments which will try to find out what minerals are present on the lunar surface and study the chemical composition of the soil.
Pragyaan will communicate only with the lander which will send the information to the orbiter from Chandrayaan-2 - which is still circling the Moon - to pass it on to the Earth for analysis.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has said that the rover will move at a speed of 1cm per second - with each step it will also leave on the Moon's surface the imprint of Isro's logo and emblem embossed on its six wheels.
The landing coincides with the start of a lunar day - a day on the Moon equals a little over four weeks on Earth and this will mean the lander and rover will have 14 days of sunlight to charge their batteries.
Once night falls, they will discharge and stop working. It is not yet clear whether they will come back to life when the next lunar day starts.
The lander is also carrying several scientific instruments which will help find out what goes on the Moon's surface and above and below it.
Moon is thought to hold important minerals but one of the major goals of Chandrayaan-3 is to hunt for water - scientists say the huge craters in the south pole region which are permanently in shadow hold ice which could support human habitation on the Moon in future.
It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations.

Watch a live simulation of the moment Indiaâs Chandrayaan-3 lands on the Moon
On Wednesday, tense moments preceded the touchdown as the lander began its precarious descent. The lander's speed was gradually reduced from 1.68km per second to almost zero, enabling it to make a soft landing on the lunar surface.
The historic moment was greeted with celebrations across the country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying "India is now on the Moon" and that "we have reached where no other country could".
The landing came just days after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft spun out of control and crashed into the Moon.
The crash also put the spotlight on the difficult terrain of the south pole region where the surface is "very uneven" and "full of craters and boulders".
India's second lunar mission, which also attempted to soft-land there in 2019, was unsuccessful - its lander and rover were destroyed, though its orbiter survived. Its continues to circle the Moon even today and is helping the Vikram lander send images and data to Earth for analysis.
India is not the only country with an eye on the Moon - there's a growing global interest in it, with many other missions headed to the lunar surface in the near future. And scientists say there is still much to understand about the Moon that's often described as a gateway to deep space.

Headline: North Korea's second spy satellite launch fails
Article Content:
North Korea's second attempt to put a spy satellite into space has failed, three months after its first launch crashed into the sea.
The attempt on Thursday morning failed during the third stage of its flight, state media said.
For North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a spy satellite is a coveted prize, as it would let him monitor incoming attacks and plot his own more accurately.
Pyongyang's space agency has said it will try again in October.
South Korea said it detected the launch of the rocket at around 03:50 local time (18:50 GMT), and that it had flown through international airspace over the Yellow Sea between mainland China and the Korean peninsula.
The launch prompted an emergency warning in Japan's southernmost Okinawa prefecture minutes later, urging residents to take cover indoors. The alert was lifted after about 20 minutes.
Condemning the launch, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said: "Behaviour like this goes against the UN resolutions and we're already firmly protesting."
The US urged North Korea to refrain from "further threatening activity" and called on Pyongyang to engage in serious diplomacy.
But although Thursday's failure will have been disappointing for Pyongyang, it appears they've made progress.
A news report in state-run KCNA blamed the failure on "an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight", and said the problem was "not a big issue".
It seems the rocket carrying the satellite flew further than during the previous attempt. Officials in Pyongyang had described the botched attempt in May as their "gravest failure" while vowing to try again.
And Mr Kim will most likely continue, until he succeeds. Already he is forging ahead with his weapons programme, while refusing all offers to talk to the US.
Thursday's launch comes days after leaders from the US, Japan and South Korea met at a historic summit in Washington. It also follows the start of annual military exercises between Washington and Seoul.

Headline: Where was Prigozhin before the crash?
Article Content:
Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin is presumed dead in a private jet crash near Moscow.
Here's what we know about his movements in the lead-up to the fatal crash.
The Russian aviation authority said the crashed plane was an Embraer.
A Legacy 600 model from that maker has long been linked to Prigozhin. It has the registration number RA-02795.
An unverified video from one of the crash sites shows debris with the last few digits of a registration number painted on - the numbers appear to be 795.
This aircraft is registered to Autolex Transport which the US government has linked to the Wagner boss.
It is presumed to have been in Moscow since 18 July as this was its first flight listed since then.
A spokesperson for FlightRadar24, a popular plane tracking website, said it's likely the jet was wasn't used during this period.
But there are only partial flight records for its previous travel history, with frequent long gaps when it had been travelling outside Russia.
We can't confirm where the plane departed from before the crash, and we can't confirm if Prigozhin was on-board.
In recent months it made several journeys to and from Moscow and St Petersburg, and has been pictured several times by local media in Belarus, where Wagner is now thought to be based.
There has been speculation that Prigozhin was travelling on a different plane, registered as RA-02748.
Several media outlets have also tied this plane to the Wagner boss.
Flight records - also partially inaccessible - show that it departed from St Petersburg earlier on Wednesday and flew towards Moscow. Its tracking data stops near Ostafyevo airport in the Russian capital.
It flew on Thursday from Moscow to Baku, Azerbaijan.
The luxury jet has flown frequently this year - within Russia, and to areas of the Middle East, central Asia and Africa.
Yet another plane linked in news reports to Wagner, an IL-76 with the registration number RA-76845, left Moscow on 18 August for Damascus, Syria and travelled to Bamako in Mali the following day.
It flew back to Damascus on 20 August and on 21 August flew back to Moscow.
This is the same day the video showing Prigozhin supposedly in Africa was released.
Although much has been made of the planes linked to Wagner, Prigozhin had kept a relatively low profile since his short-lived mutiny in June and confirmed sightings have been rare.
He last appeared in a video shared on Telegram on 21 August. In it, he's wearing military camouflage and holding an assault rifle, and says that Wagner is recruiting "heroic warriors" to make Russia "even greater".
He's surrounded by other men in military fatigues near military vehicles, and he hints that he's currently in Africa.
All Eyes on Wagner, a group that monitors the mercenary organisation, has suggested it was filmed in Mali. However, the BBC has not been able to verify this, or when the video was filmed.
Prigozhin's last confirmed sighting was in the Russian city of St Petersburg on 27 July, during a summit of African and Russian leaders. He was photographed shaking hands with a presidential adviser from the Central African Republic.
Before this, he appeared in a video that emerged on Telegram channels in mid-July, in which he welcomed Wagner fighters to their new home in Belarus.
BBC Verify located the video to a new Wagner base at Tsel, about 64 miles (103km) from the capital, Minsk.
Journalist Andrey Zakharov has alleged that Prigozhin had been travelling to Russia from Africa with all of the Wagner senior leadership on 23 August.
President Putin appeared to back up at least part of this on Thursday in remarks broadcast on television. "As far as I'm aware, he only yesterday returned from Africa. He met certain official persons there," Interfax quoted Putin as saying.

Headline: Is a new bloc emerging to rival US leadership?
Article Content:
The announced expansion of the five-nation Brics club of emerging economies was described as "historic" by Chinese President Xi Jinping, but it is still not clear how far the countries' common interests stretch.
The growth of Brics "willâ¦ further strengthen the force for world peace and development" the president said while addressing the leaders gathered at a conference centre in South Africa's commercial hub, Johannesburg.
The Brics countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - are often seen as a counterweight to the Western-led world.
The six new countries - Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - are set to join in January.
China was the state pushing hardest for group expansion as a way to counter Western dominance.
Steve Tsang, director of London's Soas China Institute, says though the Brics members do not have much in common on the surface, President Xi was trying to show his fellow bloc members that they all want a similar future: none of them want to live in a Western dominated world.
"What the Chinese are offering is an alternative world order for which autocrats can feel safe and secure in their own countries," says Prof Tsang.
"They can find an alternative direction of development without having to accept the conditionalities imposed by the democratic Americans and European powers."
The host, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, beamed as he made the announcement about the new joiners.
"We value the interest of other countries in building a partnership with Brics," Mr Ramaphosa said.
He went on to say that more countries will join in the future after the core nations agree on criteria for membership.
But there were divisions this time on how many countries should be allowed to join and how quickly.
A leaders' press conference was scheduled for Wednesday after rumours were swirling about five countries being added to the bloc, but it was cancelled at the last minute.
Then Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula Da Silva was a no-show to Wednesday's leadership dinner.
We do not know why exactly, but he is very conscious about maintaining ties with his Western allies, and was picky about admittance.
Then late Wednesday night, journalists received an advisory for an early morning press conference, just for it to be delayed again by two hours. These were signs that discussions were under way until the very last minute, as there was a surprise sixth country added.
At the press event, the leaders from each country were then able to give individual reactions to the news.
Russian President Vladmir Putin joined by video link from Russia because of the danger of being arrested over alleged war crimes in Ukraine.
In his remarks, he once again took aim at Western powers, saying their "neo-liberalism" posed a threat to both traditional values in developing countries and to the emergence of a multi-polar world where no one country or bloc dominated.
Without naming names, it was clear who President Putin was speaking about: the United States.
And though the super-power was not at the meeting, the US was talked about, or referenced, quite a bit.
On Tuesday, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan attempted to play down the bloc's expansion plans.
He said that due to Brics countries' divergence of views on critical issues, he did not see it as "evolving into some kind of geo-political rival to the United States or anyone else".
And he may be right.
Of the six new members, none are seen as anti-American states, according to Sarang Shidore, director of the Global South programme at the Quincy Institute in Washington.
"I think the message is that this is a diverse set of countries, none of them are close US allies, formal allies, two or three of them will be US opponents. But more broadly, this is not a group of anti-American states," he told the BBC.
Nevertheless, the Brics expansion does represent a shift.
"No longer is it a world where the US can set all the norms, or drive all the institutions. There's no question about that.  But a replacement? No, I would say much more of a complementarity than a replacement that is on the horizon," Mr Shidore added.
So for a group that says they all value and respect each other's opinions, maybe no-one won or lost. It really was just a diplomatic gathering with some give and take.
Mr Putin was not arrested, and thanks to modern day technology, Russia was still represented.
China got its big plan for membership expansion.
Brazil's push for a common currency is being taken seriously.
India was seen as trying to balance its friendship with America.
And South Africa, hosted a successful meeting with no public fallouts.

Headline: Protests over economic hardship intensify in Syria
Article Content:
Protests against Syria's government are intensifying in the country's south, amid widespread anger over its decision to cut fuel subsidies when millions of people are already struggling to afford basic goods because of hyperinflation.
A large banner showing President Bashar al-Assad hanging in one of the main squares in the city of Suweida is seen being set on fire in one video shared on social media over the past week.
"We want everyone to come out to the streets across Syria," says a man in another clip. "We are here against poverty and humiliation, calling for our rights. Everyone should be out protesting."
Crowds have even been filmed calling for the fall of the president, with chants such as "Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad" echoing those of 2011 pro-democracy uprising that descended into civil war.
Government-held Suweida has witnessed protests against Mr Assad over the past 12 years, but this is the first time that such slogans have been heard on its streets.
His regime has long been careful in its dealings with the minority Druze sect whose followers make up most of the residents of the city and its surrounding province. It has tolerated dissent there to a larger degree than it would in other areas under its control.
Some protesters have also been taking place in neighbouring Deraa province, where the 2011 uprising began but which was retaken by the government seven years later.
Deteriorating living conditions have pushed many people to take to the streets in recent months.
But the protests intensified last week, after the government announced the total lifting of subsidies on petrol and a partial lifting of subsidies on fuel oil.
A worsening economic crisis, with a currency collapse fuelling hyperinflation, has left almost 90% of the population living below the poverty line. But the sudden spike in fuel prices has made the situation even worse.
Some public sector workers' monthly income is worth as little as $20 (Â£15.80) at the black market exchange rate. That has left them unable to afford even essential food supplies for their families.
Earlier in the month, a new group calling itself "The 10th of August Movement" issued a statement calling for living conditions to be improved in Syria. Many of those behind the group are believed to be from Mr Assad's minority Alawite sect, which has steadfastly supported him during the war.
The statement demanded the government raise the monthly minimum wage so that it was worth at least $100; provide electricity for at least 20 hours a day, up from the current average of three in most areas; and issue new passports within a month, signalling the desire of many young people to leave the country. The statement also called for the release of political prisoners.
In recent days, photos of people in various cities across Syria with letters making similar demands and expressing opposition to Mr Assad's rule have posted on social media.
Exiled opposition groups hope that these developments will lead to lead to long awaited changes, but the president's hold on power appears to be secure for now.
The criticism from his fellow Alawites will, however, be a cause for concern for Mr Assad.
Some are reported to have been arrested after they took to social media platforms to call on the president to act.
Ahmed Ibrahim Ismail is one of them. He is from Jableh, a town in the north-western coastal province of Latakia that is the heartland of the Alawites.
Mr Ismail publicly criticised the president following a TV interview two weeks ago.
"I wished to hear something else from you... You are flying away from reality. I am very disappointed. I haven't anything from you to tackle my pain," he said.
He went on to describe his deteriorating living conditions.
A few days later, Mr Ismail's daughter announced on her Facebook that he had been detained.
Many similar stories have been circulating online.
During the past 12 years of protests and war, many have argued that Mr Assad would be able to stay in power unless the Alawite community turned against him.
So far, there is no evidence of a strong organised movement that could threaten his rule, but the growing public anger - especially among Alawites - could be the start of something bigger.

Headline: Is climate change real? Only one Republican said so
Article Content:
One of the most illuminating moments in the Republican debate came 20 minutes in. The reaction to it was swift and - among some young people and scientists - angry.
Did humans contribute to climate change? That was the question from the Fox News moderators to the eight presidential hopefuls on stage.
After reading out some statistics from the deadly Hawaii wildfires, they played a clip from a member of the Young Americans for Freedom, a conservative youth activist organisation, who said climate was the number one issue for young people.
Asked to raise their hand if they thought mankind was to blame, not one went up. And only one candidate said climate change was real in the short discussion that followed.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said it was childish to ask for a show of hands and instead laid into Joe Biden for the president's response to Hawaii.
Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley went the furthest in agreeing with the question by saying: "Is climate change real? Yes it is."
It was up to China and India to lower emissions, she said.
Cutting the US carbon footprint has been costly to the economy and put the country at a disadvantage globally, said Tim Scott. The South Carolina senator said bringing jobs "home from China" would help ease that pain and improve the environment.
One Republican candidate said the climate change agenda was a hoax.
"The reality is that the anti-carbon agenda is the wet blanket on our economy," said Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech millionaire and the youngest candidate in the field. "More people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change."
Boos followed. But as he prefaced his remark by saying he was the only one on stage not "bought and paid for", it was unclear what the audience was responding to.
Instead of answering the climate question, Chris Christie turned his fire on Mr Ramaswamy, calling him a "guy who sounds like a ChatGPT" and the discussion descended into chaos.
Donald Trump, who chose not to attend, has in the past minimised the threat of climate change by joking about oceans rising by one hundredth of an inch over 300 years. As president, he pulled out of the Paris climate accord.
The issue has become more talked about as extreme weather has caused havoc in the US. More than 100 people were killed on the Hawaiian island of Maui by wildfires and hundreds more remain missing, while California has been battered by its first tropical storm in 80 years.
The American Conservation Coalition, which mobilises young people around environmental action, condemned what they heard on stage in Milwaukee. Challenging Mr Ramaswamy directly, they said: "No, climate change is not a hoax. Candidates with this thinking are completely out of touch with young conservatives."
They then thanked Mrs Haley for being the only person on stage "bold enough to tackle climate change head-on".
The Sunrise Movement, a youth activist group which campaigns on climate change, said: "Vivek calls climate change a hoax. We call bluff that he's been outside this summer."
This year has already seen the hottest day ever recorded, the hottest month and - very likely - will also become the hottest year on record.
The science is clear-cut - the world's rising temperatures are the result of man-made climate change.
So it is perhaps not surprising that many climate scientists reacted with dismay at the opinions expressed during the Republican debate.
Corinne Le Quere, professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia was unambiguous - humans are causing climate change.
"This is not a political issue, it is a scientific fact that stems from overwhelming evidence from observed climate and from understanding the Earth's physical processes."
Professor Ed Hawkins, a climatologist at the University of Reading, agreed that whether humans are causing climate change is not a matter of belief. "It is a scientific fact, endorsed by the climate science community, learned societies and every government around the world," he said.
"How to respond to that fact is certainly a matter for political debate, and that is where the focus needs to be," he continued.
The climatologist Professor Michael E Mann of the University of Pennsylvania was more pungent. The Republican Party "is not just a threat to the nation. It is a threat to the planet", he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Meanwhile the meteorologist Eric Holthaus posted "Climate denial is alive and well in the year 2023."

Headline: Gaslighting and shame: Uncovering the Magdalene Laundries
Article Content:
The Magdalene Laundries were back in the spotlight recently following the death of Irish singer Sinead O'Connor, who spent time in one of the former asylums as a teenager. A new BBC drama examines the impact of the abuse which took place at some of these notorious institutions.
Many of the obituaries published following O'Connor's death last month noted the time she spent as a young woman in Dublin's An Grianan Training Centre, a Catholic-run institution which used to be the High Park Magdalene Laundry, where children and teenagers were routinely treated badly.
The laundries had been theoretically set up to house "fallen women" - a blanket term which included unmarried mothers, women deemed to have been badly behaved, promiscuous or sexually abused, or who were considered uncooperative or burdens on their families.
Shoplifting and truancy led to O'Connor being placed in the institution for 18 months in her teens. She later referred to it as a "prison", where she said she was deprived of a normal childhood, and girls "cried every day".
Women lived and worked without wages - O'Connor recalled being assigned jobs such as washing priests' clothes for no pay. She said the women generally studied maths and typing and had limited contact with their families.
The singer's time there did help set her own path to a career in music, after one nun gave her a guitar and connected her with a music teacher. But glints of light and hope such as this were rare.
Coincidentally, the BBC commissioned a six-part TV drama about the Magdalene Laundries last year, prior to O'Connor's death. Created and written by Joe Murtagh and starring Ruth Wilson, the Woman in the Wall launches on BBC One on Sunday at 21:00 BST.
Murtagh says his primary motivation for writing about the laundries was to increase awareness of a story about which many still know little.
"Outside of Ireland, in my experience, this isn't really known about, and with the people who do tend to know about it, it's because they've seen films including the Magdalene Sisters or Philomena," he tells BBC News.
"When you read into it, you see how harrowing it was, the scale of it, and how many tens of thousands of lives it's touched. It was a bit of history that interested me and engaged me emotionally, but the driving factor was just people not knowing about it enough."
The image conjured up by many when they think of the laundries is of the young women, mostly teens, who were held there. But actress Wilson, who stars in and co-produced the series, notes that women of all ages were admitted.
"Particular things shocked me, like women who were going into these laundries in their 40s - because they got pregnant out of wedlock," she says.
"Grown women, it wasn't just girls, it was women of all ages, the oldest was something like 89. They were shamed into these institutions."
Wilson and Murtagh both did extensive research while working on the show - which included reading books, watching documentaries and speaking to real-life survivors.
"Another thing that shocked me, and this didn't happen in all of them, but in some of them, the girls gave birth, and then they'd have to nurse their child for two years, and then their child was taken away from them," says Wilson.
"Stuff like that is horrific; the fact that girls weren't given any gas and air or weren't stitched up after birth. The nuns wouldn't let them. Things like that, you just go, wow, it's pure horror."
Some women who stayed at the former institutions have told of being physically or sexually abused, and many said they spent their time scrubbing floors and doing other physical labour.
An estimated 30,000 women were confined in the laundries over the years, and the impact of time spent there on the survivors was significant and long-lasting.
O'Connor's time at the former laundry laid the groundwork for her appearance on Saturday Night Live in 1992, which saw her tear up a picture of the Pope live on air in protest against sexual and physical abuse in the Catholic Church, telling the stunned audience: "Fight the real enemy."
Years later, Pope John Paul II would acknowledge that abuse had taken place in Catholic institutions across the world. But it took years for the women who had been housed at the laundries to be taken seriously. Wilson refers to the denial or downplaying of what happened to them as a form of "gaslighting".
"The silence around it, if your experience is denied, over and over again... the experience itself is horrific, but the aftermath of nobody listening to you, and actively denying that what you're saying is true, I imagine that's deeply traumatic too," she says.
"Any chance to get this story understood or get people to dig a bit deeper or read about it, I hope must be a little bit of validation."
Set in 2015, the Woman in the Wall follows Lorna (Wilson) - a clearly damaged woman who is often aggressive with those around her. It soon transpires that, as a teenager, Lorna's baby was taken from her after she was forced to attend a convent.
Wilson is no stranger to playing unpredictable and sometimes unhinged women, such as Alice Morgan in Luther.
But the inner turmoil she portrays here hints at something far darker, a woman who carries truly chilling memories. Wilson hopes the audience "will try to understand this character at the heart of it and why she's acting the way she does".
"Yes, she's damaged, but she's damaged because of what happened to her. The world has treated her like she's mad, but actually, they're mad for putting her inside. If someone has been gaslit their whole life, how will they feel?"
The series is set in the fictional Irish town of Kilkinure, where local women have been campaigning for the state to recognise that the convent was a former Magdalene Laundry.
Murtagh says part of the reason for setting the series somewhere fictional was to "protect any people that we spoke to" during the period of researching.
"We didn't want anyone to be able to point their finger at any one person, institution or place, and thereby discredit them or their stories," he explains.
"It was also an opportunity to be able to compile all the research we did and draw on as many stories as we could, and set it all in the one fictional town."
The women in the series fight for justice and acknowledgement, pointing out how recently the laundries were in operation. "People think this couldn't happen again, but the last laundry closed in 1996," points out one character. "It wasn't medieval times, the Macarena was in the charts."
But for a series with such a grim theme, there are still moments of levity. The snappy, acerbic dialogue, delivered with characteristic Irish humour, will be familiar to fans of playwright Martin McDonagh's style.
The first episode is both engaging and educational. While horrific historical abuse and its long-lasting impact is the core theme of the show, it otherwise plays out as a traditional whodunnit involving mystery, murder and local detectives.
Murtagh, who has said he does not have a personal connection to the laundries, says it was important not to be "exploitative" in the process of writing the series, adding that it was "tricky to balance" the blend of fact and fiction.
But, he adds, placing a murder mystery at the core of the drama provided an opportunity to "smuggle a story like [the Magdalene laundries] under the radar".
"My natural sensibility is to play with genre anyway, but what I find really useful about genre is everyone has this inherent understanding of how genre works, how horror or comedy should function," he says.
"So it provides a useful vehicle for everyone to grasp on to, so you've immediately got something that is easier to transport as dark and relatively unknown as this to a wider audience."
The first two episodes of The Woman In The Wall air on Sunday 27 and Monday 28 August at 21:00 BST on BBC One. The series then continues weekly on Mondays on BBC One and also on iPlayer.
